185
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:15,158
You know the rules.

186
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:18,245
You leave the organization without asking
and you die.

187
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:21,248
Sakamoto broke those rules.

188
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:23,500
That's why we can't let him live.

189
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,919
And remember this, Shin...

somebody else will.

And if it has to be done...

203

So be it.

204

Pathetic.

Why are you covering for him?

307
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:34,245
He means something to people.

308
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:36,122
He's found a home in this town.

309
00:15:36,206 --> 00:15:39,334
Sakamoto threw away his responsibilities.

310
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:41,753
He broke the rules of our world.

311
00:15:41,836 --> 00:15:43,254
I gotta kill him.

312
00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:47,425
If it's about responsibility,
then let me die in his place.

313
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:49,094
Just let him go.

314
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:50,261
Leave him alone!

00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:52,931

I'll spare Sakamoto.

I'd never do that, you worthless fool.

322
00:16:11,658 --> 00:16:13,201
Now hurry up and die.

323
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:15,453

It's like he knows what we're gonna do
before we do it.

354
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,791
That's because he's clairvoyant.

355
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:45,251
He can read your mind
if you get too close to him.
