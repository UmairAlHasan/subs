Subtitle by : Umair Hassan

00:00:05.818 --> 00:00:07.194
Thanks for shopping with us!

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:43.833
{\an8}SAKAMOTO'S

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:46.418
{\an8}Man, Mr. Sakamoto,
you were so cool the other day!

00:01:46.502 --> 00:01:47.586
{\an8}VS. SON HEE AND BACHO

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.256
That close-quarters combat was insane!

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:51.757
Never seen anything like it!

00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:55.344
Even retired,
you're the absolute best for sure!

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:58.055
Bam, bam, and then a counterpunch!

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.973
Get back to work.

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:01.642
And most of them
you killed with a single blow!

00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:02.560
What's that?

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:04.270
"Killed"?

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:06.105
Honey,

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:09.316
you aren't going back to being a hit man,
are you?

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.989
But you killed all those guys,
just the other day.

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:16.532
Made sure it wasn't fatal.

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:19.827
Honey, do I need to remind you

00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:23.664
that I will file for divorce
if you break our family rule?

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:25.833
Divorce!

00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:31.964
Good, I was just checking.

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:34.592
I'm going to go sweep outside.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.055
So, what's this about a "family rule"?

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:46.854
You have to stop killing me in your mind!

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:48.856
Keep your mouth shut.

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:50.816
NIIKITA CHINATOWN

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:56.071
So this is Niikita Chinatown!

00:02:56.155 --> 00:02:57.656
There's so much to see!

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:02.453
{\an8}But why'd we come all the way here
to buy items for the shop?

00:03:05.247 --> 00:03:06.457
Thanks, come again!

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.252
Only 50 per day!

00:03:10.336 --> 00:03:11.503
"Heavenly Pork Buns"?

00:03:11.587 --> 00:03:13.714
Is this what you came here for?

00:03:13.797 --> 00:03:16.175
Got enough for Aoi and Hana, too.

00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:24.892
He loves his family so much!

00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:28.812
{\an8}By the way, what was that "family rule"
Ms. Aoi was talking about?

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:29.772
Drop it.

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:31.815
No need to explain, just think about it!

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:33.359
And I'll take a peek!

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:36.779
{\an8}Get out of my way!

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:41.575
Mr. Sakamoto!

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:45.788
HEAVENLY PORK BUNS

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:49.083
Oh no, the Heavenly Pork Buns!

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:52.253
If we brush the dirt off, maybe we can...

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.755
Maybe not.

00:03:55.256 --> 00:03:56.298
There she is!

00:03:56.382 --> 00:03:58.384
- You bitch!
- Get her!

00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:02.596
{\an8}MYSTERY GIRL
LU SHAOTANG

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.975
Think you can shake us
sneaking through alleys like a cat?

00:04:06.058 --> 00:04:08.852
As if I'd get caught
by a bunch of dummies like you!

00:04:08.936 --> 00:04:12.940
Mr. Sakamoto?
We might want to leave before things...

00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:14.817
They're ruined.

00:04:18.862 --> 00:04:21.657
Sorry, this is no time
to be worrying about that!

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.333
Wow, she's using tai chi!

00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:32.793
Surround her!

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:43.220
You little--

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.937
I've got you now.

00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:54.148
Hey! Let go of me!

00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:58.402
Keep her alive, but mess her up good.

00:05:00.237 --> 00:05:02.448
Let's get those legs first,
so you can't run away.

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:12.624
Who the hell is this guy?

00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:19.840
Freeze! Not another step!

00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:21.550
- No!
- I'll kill--

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:39.860
What's her story?

00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:41.737
Look, there she is!

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.198
She's with her gang! Get 'em all!

00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:45.908
"Her gang"?

00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:47.951
We're outta here!

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:48.911
After them!

00:05:48.994 --> 00:05:50.329
You won't get away!

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.040
Who even are you guys?

00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:55.292
Shit!

00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:00.255
DAN, INC.

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:01.882
Where's the girl?

00:06:02.466 --> 00:06:04.593
It seems she's slipped away...

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:07.721
She had two men helping her escape.

00:06:07.805 --> 00:06:09.848
We're looking into who they are.

00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:13.143
You let her get away again?

00:06:13.227 --> 00:06:14.311
{\an8}CEO OF DAN, INC.

00:06:14.394 --> 00:06:18.774
We killed her entire clan
tracking her down!

00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:22.319
If she disappears,
it'll all have been for nothing!

00:06:22.402 --> 00:06:23.737
You idiot!

00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:25.823
I'm terribly sorry, sir!

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:27.241
Enough!

00:06:27.324 --> 00:06:28.575
Get out of my sight!

00:06:30.452 --> 00:06:31.662
Send them in.

00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:32.871
Yes--

00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:46.343
Look, Son Hee,
his head is still gasping for air!

00:06:46.927 --> 00:06:48.428
You fool...

00:06:48.512 --> 00:06:50.639
We don't play with dead bodies.

00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:53.350
It's tasteless, Bacho.

00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:56.603
These brothers are psychotic...

00:06:56.687 --> 00:06:57.896
Listen to me.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.983
What we need is that girl's key.

00:07:01.066 --> 00:07:02.943
Once we have that key,

00:07:03.026 --> 00:07:05.279
we will be able
to rule all of the black market!

00:07:05.362 --> 00:07:08.073
I don't care what it takes. Find the girl!

00:07:08.157 --> 00:07:12.077
That means we can kill anyone
that gets in our way, correct?

00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:14.413
Do what you want.

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:18.876
What?!

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:20.669
You're the daughter of a mafia family?

00:07:20.752 --> 00:07:23.505
And not just any mafia family,
but the Lu clan?

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:25.299
Don't announce it to the whole world!

00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:27.509
What do they want from you?

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:30.762
This little guy.

00:07:30.846 --> 00:07:31.763
A key?

00:07:31.847 --> 00:07:34.808
The key to our clan's hidden vault.

00:07:34.892 --> 00:07:36.435
My parents trusted me with it.

00:07:36.518 --> 00:07:39.146
Screw that, just get rid of it.

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:40.981
Nothing's worth your own life.

00:07:41.607 --> 00:07:43.108
No way in hell!

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.236
My dad and mom

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:49.239
died protecting this key.

00:07:53.994 --> 00:07:56.246
Shaotang, you go on ahead!

00:07:57.206 --> 00:07:59.124
Run! Hurry!

00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:09.009
If I let those guys get this now,

00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:12.429
how can I face my parents in heaven?

00:08:13.847 --> 00:08:17.267
Oh, I got carried away.
This isn't your problem.

00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:19.144
Sorry for the trouble!

00:08:22.523 --> 00:08:24.066
I guess this is goodbye.

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:28.612
Do you know how to make
an authentic pork bun?

00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:31.156
Huh? A pork bun?

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:36.453
Well, my dad taught me the basics,
so I guess I could.

00:08:36.537 --> 00:08:39.998
Mr. Sakamoto, don't get involved in this!

00:08:40.082 --> 00:08:42.209
I have a bad feeling about her.

00:08:42.292 --> 00:08:44.711
Cancel today's shopping trip.

00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:46.964
We're going to save this girl.

00:08:48.549 --> 00:08:52.636
But you have to make us pork buns
once we get you back alive.

00:08:52.719 --> 00:08:54.096
Do we have a deal?

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:56.765
The heck? Are you two...

00:08:58.433 --> 00:08:59.393
Mr. Sakamoto!

00:09:08.277 --> 00:09:09.695
Mr. Sakamoto!

00:09:09.778 --> 00:09:12.155
They caught up while we were yakking.

00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:13.699
Also,

00:09:14.366 --> 00:09:16.618
the situation just got a lot worse.

00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:21.707
Bacho, I keep telling you,
your hits are in bad taste.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:26.587
Oh, shut up.
There's no "taste" in hits to begin with.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.298
We see, we kill.

00:09:29.381 --> 00:09:32.342
If you want,
we can line up their dead bodies all nice.

00:09:32.426 --> 00:09:35.429
I'm talking about the way you kill.

00:09:35.929 --> 00:09:38.348
It's like I'm talking to a baboon.

00:09:38.432 --> 00:09:40.309
What's with these guys?

00:09:40.392 --> 00:09:42.561
Son Hee and Bacho.

00:09:42.644 --> 00:09:44.187
They're twin hit men.

00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:49.067
They charge an absurd amount of money,
but never miss their target.

00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:52.946
They're serial killers that find joy
in slaughtering people.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.325
They make sketches of
their victims' heads as a hobby.

00:09:56.408 --> 00:09:57.784
They're insane!

00:09:57.868 --> 00:10:00.621
I guess we're famous now.

00:10:00.704 --> 00:10:02.331
Isn't that nice, Son Hee?

00:10:02.414 --> 00:10:03.665
You moron.

00:10:03.749 --> 00:10:05.292
We're hit men.

00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:07.461
We should be ashamed
that we're drawing attention.

00:10:07.544 --> 00:10:09.671
Yeah, you should be ashamed!

00:10:11.715 --> 00:10:14.760
Are you mad 'cause we killed your friend?

00:10:14.843 --> 00:10:17.137
Looks like Lu's
not the only little girl here.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.431
You think you killed my friend?

00:10:19.973 --> 00:10:21.600
You must be pretty dumb.

00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:27.648
Only an amateur hit man
wouldn't know Taro Sakamoto.

00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:29.900
Talk while you can, kid.

00:10:51.713 --> 00:10:53.006
Son of a...

00:10:53.632 --> 00:10:55.258
Who are you?

00:11:00.597 --> 00:11:02.891
Red bean buns would be nice too.

00:11:14.694 --> 00:11:15.987
Where are we?

00:11:17.322 --> 00:11:18.740
{\an8}CLOSED

00:11:18.824 --> 00:11:22.619
That guy packs quite a punch.

00:11:22.702 --> 00:11:24.204
Don't you think, Bacho?

00:11:26.248 --> 00:11:28.250
The roof must have been rotting.

00:11:28.834 --> 00:11:30.961
I'm gonna destroy him.

00:11:31.044 --> 00:11:32.170
Little lady.

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:37.426
Hand over the key now,
and I'll give you an elegant death.

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:38.427
Deal?

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.679
This is all I have left of my parents...

00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:43.682
I'll guard it with my life!

00:11:43.765 --> 00:11:45.684
Oh, my.

00:11:45.767 --> 00:11:49.521
Your parents said something like that
before I diced them up.

00:11:50.439 --> 00:11:51.857
What a shame.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.985
Obsessing over some object
over your own life?

00:11:55.068 --> 00:11:57.362
What terrible, terrible taste.

00:11:57.446 --> 00:11:58.447
Shut up!

00:11:59.156 --> 00:12:00.157
No!

00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:05.829
How dare you!

00:12:05.912 --> 00:12:09.207
Don't be dumb.
You can't let them get under your skin.

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:16.006
That vault contains all my ancestors'
wishes and hopes for generations.

00:12:16.673 --> 00:12:18.467
Dad died protecting that.

00:12:19.134 --> 00:12:20.677
Killed by these assholes...

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.887
Okay, then.

00:12:25.098 --> 00:12:27.100
Come on now, don't get in our way!

00:12:27.684 --> 00:12:31.354
She was so close to seeing her
beloved parents again.

00:12:31.438 --> 00:12:35.484
No one has the right
to tell others what's important or not.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:39.905
Why...

00:12:39.988 --> 00:12:43.366
Why are you risking your life to help me?

00:12:54.836 --> 00:12:56.463
You're covered in blood again...

00:12:57.297 --> 00:12:58.924
I had work...

00:12:59.508 --> 00:13:02.511
"Work"? I think you mean "murder"!

00:13:02.594 --> 00:13:04.554
How can you do something like that?

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:08.141
I had to work
so I could buy you a present...

00:13:08.225 --> 00:13:11.561
I don't want it. You're handing it to me
with literal blood on your hands!

00:13:14.314 --> 00:13:15.649
That's it.

00:13:17.984 --> 00:13:20.612
If you can't change your ways,

00:13:20.695 --> 00:13:21.821
I guess...

00:13:23.281 --> 00:13:24.491
we can't be together.

00:13:25.534 --> 00:13:26.409
Bye-bye.

00:13:35.835 --> 00:13:37.212
- Someone fell!
- What?!

00:13:43.969 --> 00:13:46.221
That was a longer drop than I thought.

00:13:46.346 --> 00:13:48.598
Thank goodness for this snow!

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.601
See?

00:13:51.685 --> 00:13:56.231
You'd miss me if I died, wouldn't you?

00:13:57.357 --> 00:13:58.233
Don't you get it?

00:13:58.316 --> 00:14:01.736
The feeling that made you want to save me

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.490
is shared by every person out there.
Everyone is loved by someone.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.369
So please, promise me...

00:14:13.748 --> 00:14:15.458
you won't kill anymore.

00:14:16.209 --> 00:14:17.919
That's our rule.

00:14:18.628 --> 00:14:20.672
To make up for
all the people you've killed,

00:14:20.755 --> 00:14:21.965
from here on out,

00:14:23.049 --> 00:14:25.385
spend your life saving people instead.

00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:33.143
The bleeding's stopped.

00:14:33.852 --> 00:14:36.062
No kill rule. Got it, Shin?

00:14:36.897 --> 00:14:38.607
Yes, Mr. Sakamoto!

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.568
Get over yourselves, you amateurs!

00:14:56.875 --> 00:14:57.709
Take this!

00:15:15.852 --> 00:15:17.687
You've got some moves.

00:15:20.649 --> 00:15:23.193
Bacho, you thinking what I'm thinking?

00:15:23.276 --> 00:15:25.946
I sure am, Brother. Let's do it!

00:15:31.242 --> 00:15:33.119
Cast-iron Technique,

00:15:33.662 --> 00:15:35.080
Slashes of Hell!

00:15:37.457 --> 00:15:39.501
We'll turn you into mincemeat!

00:15:43.463 --> 00:15:44.381
What?

00:15:45.757 --> 00:15:47.759
Are you okay, Mr. Sakamoto?

00:15:47.842 --> 00:15:49.511
I think I pulled a muscle.

00:15:50.095 --> 00:15:51.638
Here, a pain relief patch.

00:15:51.721 --> 00:15:55.183
Did he... dodge all that?

00:15:55.266 --> 00:15:57.852
But Slashes of Hell is inescapable!

00:15:57.936 --> 00:15:59.854
Not to mention how big he is.

00:15:59.938 --> 00:16:02.065
How can it be?
There's not a single scratch on him!

00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:05.777
Bacho, you thinking what I'm thinking?

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.154
I sure am, Brother. Let's do it!

00:16:09.489 --> 00:16:12.367
You're the third person to witness this!

00:16:14.035 --> 00:16:15.704
Cast-iron Technique!

00:16:22.293 --> 00:16:23.795
You bastard!

00:16:28.174 --> 00:16:31.761
My enhanced-strength chakram!

00:16:31.845 --> 00:16:33.555
Who is this man?

00:16:37.267 --> 00:16:39.936
I'm not used to that kind of weight.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:40.895
Ouch.

00:16:41.021 --> 00:16:43.064
Here, Mr. Sakamoto, for your hand.

00:16:43.148 --> 00:16:46.776
Damn it! Forget these two.

00:16:47.485 --> 00:16:49.154
I'll just get the girl!

00:16:49.237 --> 00:16:51.114
I heard that!

00:16:59.789 --> 00:17:01.458
{\an8}COOL IMPACT
REFRIGERATOR SMASH!!

00:17:10.842 --> 00:17:14.095
Seriously, who are you two?

00:17:18.892 --> 00:17:20.602
Just a couple of retail workers.

00:17:22.604 --> 00:17:25.732
I don't get you one bit.

00:17:25.815 --> 00:17:29.486
Damn it! Where's Bacho and Son Hee?

00:17:29.569 --> 00:17:32.405
There's treasure right behind these doors!

00:17:33.073 --> 00:17:36.576
All I need is that key. That little key!

00:17:36.659 --> 00:17:37.869
Delivery!

00:17:40.622 --> 00:17:42.373
Bacho! Son Hee!

00:17:43.249 --> 00:17:45.043
Who the hell are you?

00:17:45.126 --> 00:17:46.961
What did you do to my guards--

00:17:47.045 --> 00:17:48.129
Shut it.

00:17:48.213 --> 00:17:49.380
Don't say a word.

00:17:49.464 --> 00:17:51.466
You!

00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:55.053
Sorry! I'm sorry!

00:17:55.136 --> 00:17:57.931
I'll do anything! Please!

00:17:58.014 --> 00:18:01.226
"Sorry" won't bring back my parents!

00:18:01.851 --> 00:18:03.686
Get ready to repent in hell!

00:18:12.862 --> 00:18:14.739
Are you sure that's enough?

00:18:14.823 --> 00:18:16.866
Maybe a couple extra blows--

00:18:19.869 --> 00:18:22.163
Stop killing me in your mind!

00:18:22.247 --> 00:18:24.124
Stay out of it.

00:18:26.793 --> 00:18:28.128
It's enough.

00:18:30.296 --> 00:18:33.633
You can't go around killing people
every time they upset you.

00:18:33.716 --> 00:18:36.344
"Choose to live a happy life."

00:18:36.427 --> 00:18:37.887
That's what Dad always said.

00:18:43.434 --> 00:18:45.645
Anytime now, pink hair.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.314
Can it, rude guy!

00:18:48.398 --> 00:18:51.025
I have a name and it's Lu Shaotang.

00:18:51.651 --> 00:18:54.279
This key is so old, it's not turning.

00:18:57.448 --> 00:18:58.908
Now we're talking!

00:18:58.992 --> 00:19:00.118
What's inside?

00:19:00.201 --> 00:19:02.162
Hey, I should go in first!

00:19:03.872 --> 00:19:07.208
Whoa! Look at all the treasure!

00:19:08.376 --> 00:19:11.212
And books? CDs? Plushies?

00:19:11.921 --> 00:19:13.548
What a weird collection...

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:16.634
Look, an inventory.

00:19:18.386 --> 00:19:19.762
Let's see.

00:19:19.846 --> 00:19:25.476
"The head of the Lu clan shall leave
their most treasured items in this vault."

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.855
I guess each clan head
considers different things treasure.

00:19:29.606 --> 00:19:31.232
I wonder what my dad left.

00:19:38.656 --> 00:19:39.782
What does it say?

00:19:40.742 --> 00:19:44.454
"Something to drink with Shaotang
when she's of age."

00:19:46.331 --> 00:19:47.874
That's so Dad.

00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:51.502
Come on. What does it say?

00:19:53.463 --> 00:19:56.758
It says it's the best liquor on Earth!

00:19:57.258 --> 00:19:59.260
Have some! A sign of my gratitude.

00:20:01.095 --> 00:20:03.306
It better be good stuff!

00:20:05.975 --> 00:20:09.145
Mr. Sakamoto, you held on to these?

00:20:09.229 --> 00:20:12.065
What are these? Why are they all smashed?

00:20:12.148 --> 00:20:14.025
Because of you.

00:20:14.651 --> 00:20:16.486
They still taste good, though.

00:20:21.991 --> 00:20:24.661
Japanese pork buns aren't half bad.

00:21:56.627 --> 00:21:59.088
Yesterday, in Niikita Chinatown,

00:21:59.172 --> 00:22:03.092
what is believed to be a gang fight
between mafia members broke out.

00:22:03.176 --> 00:22:04.093
Witnesses say--

00:22:04.177 --> 00:22:05.762
Good morning!

00:22:05.845 --> 00:22:07.430
Too loud.

00:22:07.513 --> 00:22:10.058
Headache, hungover...

00:22:11.184 --> 00:22:13.227
Here, drink this, Mr. Sakamoto.

00:22:13.311 --> 00:22:14.354
MIKAN JUICE

00:22:14.437 --> 00:22:15.521
Welcome--

00:22:16.397 --> 00:22:18.608
Boss, this apron fits perfect.

00:22:18.691 --> 00:22:20.693
What are you doing here?

00:22:20.777 --> 00:22:24.280
I don't have a job.
I'm gonna make authentic pork buns here.

00:22:24.364 --> 00:22:27.075
But you've got all that treasure!

00:22:27.158 --> 00:22:30.953
I'm not using my family heirlooms.
Are you dense?

00:22:31.662 --> 00:22:32.789
What did you say?!

00:22:32.872 --> 00:22:34.499
Simple-minded?

00:22:34.582 --> 00:22:37.126
Please... be quiet.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.172
By the way,
I was really moved by your story.

00:22:41.255 --> 00:22:43.508
You know, the reason you stopped killing.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.259
How do you know?

00:22:46.552 --> 00:22:49.347
When we were fighting those creeps,

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.391
I saw the memory
you were thinking of, and...

00:22:54.102 --> 00:22:56.437
You're one of us now. It's your rule, too.

00:22:56.521 --> 00:22:57.438
SAKAMOTO FAMILY RULES

00:22:58.689 --> 00:22:59.649
Yes, sir.

00:23:03.194 --> 00:23:06.155
"Rule number one. Do not kill people."

00:23:06.239 --> 00:23:07.949
{\an8}I'll kill you if you do.

00:23:08.032 --> 00:23:09.826
{\an8}That contradicts your own rule!

00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:17.542
From the JAA.

00:23:17.625 --> 0
