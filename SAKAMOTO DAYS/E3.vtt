00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.775
SAKAMOTO'S

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:07.500
Subtitle by : Umair Hassan

00:00:08.946 --> 00:00:10.573
You're late!

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:15.161
You're so fussy.
Who cares if I'm a little late?

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:17.705
Two hours is not "a little"!

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.291
GREEN TEA
APPLE JUICE

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:23.169
DETERGENT

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:26.213
Come on, Lu!
You can't put the detergent in the fridge!

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:28.174
Fussing again.

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:31.385
Just put it all on the shelves,
the customers will figure it out.

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.471
You can't stuff everything in one place!

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:36.599
I bet you've never even had a job before.

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:38.517
- I have too!
- What'd you do?

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.352
I helped out with my dad's work!

00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:44.732
I dug a huge hole and tossed
gunnysacks of who-knows-what into it.

00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:49.820
Mr. Sakamoto, we have to fire her!

00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:51.947
She's ruining our peaceful atmosphere!

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:54.033
There's no such atmosphere here
to begin with.

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:54.950
EX-MAFIA

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:57.078
Shut up, we're trying to build one!

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:57.995
{\an8}EX-HIT MEN

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.080
{\an8}Now, now, Shin!

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:02.541
{\an8}We don't say mean things like that here.

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:06.087
{\an8}And Lu, you need to apologize
when you're late to work.

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:08.881
Mr. Sakamoto?

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:12.343
What's wrong, you two?

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:16.722
You look like a pair of deer
caught in rifle-mounted lights.

00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:19.308
Come now, let's get ready.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:21.185
Shin, you go sweep outside.

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:24.438
Lu, are your pork buns prepped?

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.317
Mr. Manager is chattier than I thought.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.612
I worked with him for years.
I've never heard him talk this much.

00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:33.739
He barely talks in his own mind.

00:01:33.823 --> 00:01:37.868
Do you two think that I'm some kind of
talking blob of meat?

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:39.119
How rude.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:40.704
I will kill you.

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:44.291
I am a warm-blooded human being, you know?

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:46.210
I appreciate your hard work. Really.

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:50.464
Not only is he talking too much,
he doesn't even sound like himself.

00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:52.550
SAKAMOTO

00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:55.719
Oh?

00:01:57.054 --> 00:01:58.973
Mr. Sakamoto?

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:00.266
There are two of you?

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:35.152
{\an8}WELCOME TO SUGAR PARK

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:45.329
{\an8}Well, what a surprise!
A doppelgĂ¤nger, perhaps?

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.267
Long time no see, Nagumo.

00:04:07.977 --> 00:04:10.229
I see you've still got it, Sakamoto.

00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:12.356
Thank goodness for that.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.525
How did he do that with his face?

00:04:14.608 --> 00:04:15.609
And...

00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:17.319
Why can't I read his mind?

00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:32.251
Sorry, didn't think that
I'd get you that good.

00:04:32.334 --> 00:04:34.670
Mr. Sakamoto, who is this guy?

00:04:34.753 --> 00:04:36.380
Let's stuff him in a sack!

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:38.507
My name is Nagumo.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.219
I work at the supermarket across
the street. I'm a friend of Sakamoto's.

00:04:42.928 --> 00:04:44.013
And by the way, I'm 18.

00:04:44.096 --> 00:04:47.391
A friend? And you're only 18?

00:04:47.474 --> 00:04:50.019
But there's no supermarket
across the street.

00:04:50.102 --> 00:04:52.521
He's a hit man.
We started out at the same time.

00:04:52.604 --> 00:04:53.981
He's 27.

00:04:54.064 --> 00:04:55.858
Everything you said was a lie!

00:04:55.941 --> 00:04:57.318
We aren't that gullible!

00:04:58.444 --> 00:05:01.613
There's a bounty on Sakamoto's head.

00:05:01.697 --> 00:05:03.407
The reward is one billion yen.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.867
I'm sure it's just another lie.

00:05:05.451 --> 00:05:07.745
The "one billion yen" makes it so obvious.

00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:09.621
I know kids that are better liars.

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:11.081
Nope, it's true.

00:05:11.707 --> 00:05:15.210
It was officially decided by the JAA,
just the other day.

00:05:15.836 --> 00:05:18.213
It won't be posted online
until tomorrow, but...

00:05:18.297 --> 00:05:20.966
Hello. Pizza delivery for Sakamoto?

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.469
Yay, pizza! Finally!

00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:30.976
Some guys have already caught wind
of the rumors.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.229
That the legendary hit man
is back in the game.

00:05:34.313 --> 00:05:37.107
That'll be 2,940 yen, please.

00:05:38.192 --> 00:05:40.986
Man, these guys are like sitting ducks.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.904
What?

00:05:43.447 --> 00:05:46.950
Can't believe you let me,
Pizza Nakajima, walk right in!

00:05:47.034 --> 00:05:50.370
I'm gonna slice you up like salami!

00:05:51.038 --> 00:05:52.456
{\an8}PIZZA GUY / HIT MAN
PIZZA NAKAJIMA

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.375
Hey, don't you make a move.

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:58.170
We wouldn't want to waste
such a pretty face.

00:05:59.213 --> 00:06:03.175
Sakamoto, you bastard!
Don't just sit there eating pizza!

00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:05.094
I'm gonna kill him!

00:06:07.513 --> 00:06:08.931
You little--

00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.560
See? Just like I told you.

00:06:13.644 --> 00:06:15.187
I don't like lies.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.563
How'd he do that?

00:06:19.233 --> 00:06:21.652
Nagumo, wait.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.034
Don't tell me you're gonna try
to get through this without killing.

00:06:29.118 --> 00:06:33.205
Do you really think you stand a chance
against these hit men?

00:06:33.288 --> 00:06:35.791
Or worse, against us?

00:06:38.293 --> 00:06:39.628
Just kidding.

00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:41.839
We'll stay out of it this time.

00:06:41.922 --> 00:06:44.466
We specialize in hits on hit men.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.386
Well, you'd know that,
wouldn't you, Sakamoto?

00:06:48.887 --> 00:06:51.306
Ah, fond memories of the days
we worked together.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.307
Nagumo.

00:06:53.517 --> 00:06:56.770
Who benefits from me dying
after all this time?

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:58.480
No clue.

00:06:58.564 --> 00:07:01.233
We just complete our missions.

00:07:01.984 --> 00:07:05.529
And you know, for someone who's retired,
you've drawn a lot of attention.

00:07:05.612 --> 00:07:07.823
Eliminating Dan, Inc.? That was too far.

00:07:07.906 --> 00:07:09.032
Are you stupid?

00:07:09.116 --> 00:07:11.368
Are there gonna be more guys like them?

00:07:11.452 --> 00:07:14.663
Oh, no! No more noobs like that.

00:07:15.372 --> 00:07:17.458
Well, anyway...

00:07:19.084 --> 00:07:21.170
Good seeing you, Sakamoto.

00:07:21.253 --> 00:07:23.338
I wanted to see your face one last time.

00:07:23.422 --> 00:07:24.840
Hey, wait a minute!

00:07:29.094 --> 00:07:31.597
Is he...

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.973
on our side?

00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:35.017
Maybe I should leave the country.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.355
Well... There goes our pizza guy.

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:43.484
I can't believe this fat-ass is
worth one billion yen.

00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:46.487
That black-haired guy looked way worse.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.989
Oh, who cares about that.

00:07:49.573 --> 00:07:52.743
Shouldn't you be more worried
about that outdated look of yours?

00:07:52.826 --> 00:07:53.994
What'd you say?

00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:57.498
Sorry, never mind.
Didn't mean to kill your vibe.

00:07:57.581 --> 00:07:59.875
Hey, anyone feel like pizza?

00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.461
You're underestimating Sakamoto.

00:08:03.212 --> 00:08:05.797
You have to outsmart him in every way.

00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:07.549
Time, place, everything.

00:08:08.217 --> 00:08:11.220
Find the worst possible moment for him
and strike.

00:08:11.303 --> 00:08:13.472
That's how we do it at Dondenkai.

00:08:15.098 --> 00:08:17.226
He used to be in The Order.

00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:19.394
If you're not careful,
he'll turn the tables on you.

00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:23.482
The Order? That's an urban myth.

00:08:23.565 --> 00:08:27.402
He retired five years ago, right?
I'm sure he won't be any trouble.

00:08:27.486 --> 00:08:29.488
One piece of advice.

00:08:32.658 --> 00:08:34.993
If you keep stalking me,

00:08:35.577 --> 00:08:37.204
I'm gonna show you hell.

00:08:37.287 --> 00:08:40.082
He knew the camera was there?

00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:42.751
Giving off quite a vibe, huh.

00:08:47.172 --> 00:08:49.091
- Arcade?
- Sounds good!

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:53.095
If what Nagumo said was true,

00:08:53.637 --> 00:08:57.099
will more men like that pizza guy
keep attacking you?

00:08:57.724 --> 00:08:59.768
It's no use worrying about it.

00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:02.187
Since we don't know who the enemy is,

00:09:02.271 --> 00:09:04.273
it's best if we lay low for now.

00:09:04.356 --> 00:09:05.524
Daddy!

00:09:07.526 --> 00:09:10.028
Hana's all ready for tomorrow!

00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:11.530
Ready?

00:09:11.613 --> 00:09:13.448
What's with the ears?

00:09:13.532 --> 00:09:14.825
It's Sugar Bunny!

00:09:14.908 --> 00:09:17.953
I'm super-duper excited!

00:09:18.036 --> 00:09:19.037
Sugar Bunny?

00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:22.457
I'd better get up early tomorrow
to pack our lunches.

00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:25.711
Yay! Can you do the apples
with little bunny ears?

00:09:25.794 --> 00:09:27.129
Are you going somewhere?

00:09:27.963 --> 00:09:30.924
- Damn it, I forgot!
- Bunny ears!

00:10:00.746 --> 00:10:01.622
THE VIKING

00:10:01.705 --> 00:10:04.166
That Viking ride was so much fun!

00:10:04.249 --> 00:10:07.002
A little too much for me.

00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:09.921
I think I had too many frankfurters.

00:10:10.005 --> 00:10:11.506
I'll call for a doctor!

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.509
Don't be so dramatic. Want some water?

00:10:14.593 --> 00:10:16.511
Lu-lu, look at this!

00:10:16.595 --> 00:10:18.180
{\an8}This park is so big.

00:10:18.263 --> 00:10:20.349
{\an8}It's worth three Tokyo Domes!

00:10:20.432 --> 00:10:22.267
{\an8}What's a Tokyo Dome?

00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:24.936
{\an8}And the mascot is so cute!

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.732
{\an8}It's a strong, chubby bunny
called Sugar Bunny!

00:10:28.815 --> 00:10:30.525
{\an8}Kinda like Mr. Manager.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.404
It's been a while since
we've gone out with friends.

00:10:34.488 --> 00:10:36.782
We're going to have so much fun today!

00:10:38.575 --> 00:10:42.788
There's a bounty on your head.
The reward is one billion yen.

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:47.918
This stick thing's not bad.

00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:49.086
Come on, guys!

00:10:49.169 --> 00:10:50.962
Hurry up, hurry up!

00:10:52.214 --> 00:10:53.048
Lu,

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:55.842
let's go over this again.

00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:57.844
Our mission today is to protect him...

00:10:58.011 --> 00:11:01.431
...so the Sakamotos can enjoy their day.

00:11:01.515 --> 00:11:02.974
1. STOP ENEMIES
2. FAMILY TIME

00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:05.560
But with so many people around,

00:11:05.644 --> 00:11:07.854
how are we gonna weed out the enemies?

00:11:07.938 --> 00:11:09.523
Stop looking around.

00:11:09.606 --> 00:11:10.982
There aren't any enemies near us.

00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:12.567
How do you know?

00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:15.112
Under the right conditions,

00:11:15.195 --> 00:11:18.990
I can read the minds of everyone
within a 30-meter radius.

00:11:19.074 --> 00:11:21.034
When people want to kill someone,

00:11:21.118 --> 00:11:23.578
they're usually pretty worked up about it.

00:11:23.662 --> 00:11:24.704
I see.

00:11:24.788 --> 00:11:28.542
Wait, have you been reading my mind?

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:29.793
You pervert!

00:11:29.876 --> 00:11:32.379
Shut up, of course not!

00:11:32.462 --> 00:11:34.548
I need to concentrate to do it.

00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:37.801
It's like tuning in to a radio station.

00:11:37.884 --> 00:11:40.637
So, how'd you get that--

00:11:42.097 --> 00:11:43.849
Mr. Sakamoto, enemy approaching.

00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:45.475
Got it.

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:47.352
Male at two o'clock.

00:11:48.812 --> 00:11:52.899
A family outing, huh?
You've set the bar really low.

00:11:52.983 --> 00:11:54.234
{\an8}JANITOR / HIT MAN
KURII NINGU

00:11:54.317 --> 00:11:57.446
Look, Hana! I wonder what that is?

00:12:06.997 --> 00:12:08.582
I'll wipe the floor with you!

00:12:09.666 --> 00:12:12.836
Watch what Cleaning Kurii can do!

00:12:17.424 --> 00:12:19.551
A no-look kill?

00:12:23.263 --> 00:12:24.181
What was that?

00:12:24.264 --> 00:12:26.349
- Cute bunny!
- I thought I heard something.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:33.356
Mr. Manager is something else.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.650
He didn't even glance at the enemy.

00:12:35.734 --> 00:12:36.943
Not only that,

00:12:37.027 --> 00:12:40.447
he avoided the organs and arteries
so he wouldn't die.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.617
That's like threading a needle.
It's practically impossible.

00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:48.788
See? I told him the janitor thing
wasn't a vibe anymore.

00:12:48.872 --> 00:12:51.791
But I gotta say, that Sakamoto guy...

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:52.709
WANTED

00:12:52.792 --> 00:12:57.172
His vibe is more "big softie"
than "legendary hit man."

00:12:57.255 --> 00:12:59.466
That Shin kid is a pain, though.

00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:03.637
The ability to read minds? How annoying.

00:13:04.346 --> 00:13:05.347
Wait a minute.

00:13:05.931 --> 00:13:08.517
If I don't give off a vibe,
he won't have anything to read.

00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:11.019
Problem solved.

00:13:17.692 --> 00:13:20.904
What are you doing?
Mr. Manager's going that way.

00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:23.031
Yeah.

00:13:24.866 --> 00:13:27.661
This is how kids get lost.

00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:32.249
TURBO TEDDY

00:13:32.332 --> 00:13:34.501
This is gonna be fun!

00:13:34.584 --> 00:13:36.044
It's so exciting.

00:13:36.127 --> 00:13:36.962
It's so tight.

00:13:38.547 --> 00:13:43.260
Please do not remove the safety bar
while the ride is in motion.

00:13:43.343 --> 00:13:44.970
Enjoy your journey!

00:13:45.053 --> 00:13:46.763
Off you go!

00:13:47.973 --> 00:13:50.475
- Why are we sitting all the way back here?
- Enjoy!

00:13:50.559 --> 00:13:52.769
It'll be easier to spot enemies.

00:13:52.852 --> 00:13:55.480
The back of the ride is faster, too.

00:13:55.564 --> 00:13:57.983
It's the same speed.

00:13:58.066 --> 00:13:59.651
See anyone suspicious?

00:14:01.319 --> 00:14:04.030
Doesn't seem like anyone's
got murder on the mind.

00:14:04.114 --> 00:14:06.992
Who would choose a time like this, anyway?

00:14:07.993 --> 00:14:10.745
Wait, that guy with the silver hair
looks suspicious.

00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:11.663
Really?

00:14:11.746 --> 00:14:14.165
I dunno, he's not thinking about anything.

00:14:14.249 --> 00:14:17.002
Look at him, there's no way he's normal.

00:14:17.085 --> 00:14:18.169
Hey.

00:14:18.253 --> 00:14:20.255
You can't judge a book by its cover.

00:14:20.338 --> 00:14:24.342
Hey, they noticed me.
Was I giving off a vibe without realizing?

00:14:25.385 --> 00:14:26.428
Shit!

00:14:27.596 --> 00:14:28.805
What are you doing?

00:14:28.889 --> 00:14:30.807
Removing this safety bar!

00:14:30.891 --> 00:14:33.143
What? But we're at the top...

00:14:33.226 --> 00:14:35.687
Mr. Sakamoto, an enemy got past us!

00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:38.982
Three rows behind you,
the guy with the silver hair!

00:14:46.156 --> 00:14:47.198
Damn.

00:14:47.282 --> 00:14:49.284
Bulletproof glasses, huh?

00:14:49.367 --> 00:14:51.703
I guess it couldn't be that easy.

00:14:51.786 --> 00:14:54.205
Mr. Sakamoto, I'll take care of him!

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.250
What? Are you crazy?

00:14:57.334 --> 00:14:59.794
We're coming to the loop!

00:15:01.963 --> 00:15:02.797
Hey!

00:15:22.359 --> 00:15:24.402
I need to have a word with you!

00:15:36.039 --> 00:15:37.374
That was close.

00:15:41.878 --> 00:15:44.005
Are you out of your mind?

00:15:44.089 --> 00:15:46.049
You could've killed me.

00:15:46.883 --> 00:15:49.302
Today's Mr. Sakamoto's day off.

00:15:49.386 --> 00:15:51.763
Looks like I'll have to do some overtime.

00:15:52.263 --> 00:15:55.183
Hmm? What kinda vibe is that?

00:15:57.644 --> 00:16:00.730
Damn it, I can't read him at all.

00:16:00.814 --> 00:16:02.482
He's not making this easy.

00:16:10.031 --> 00:16:11.533
Aw, you noticed.

00:16:17.872 --> 00:16:19.290
I can't dodge them both!

00:16:35.557 --> 00:16:37.434
He uses poison?

00:16:38.476 --> 00:16:40.603
Strong stuff, isn't it?

00:16:40.687 --> 00:16:43.565
It's a special blend I made myself.

00:16:44.607 --> 00:16:46.735
So, you're probably going to die now.

00:16:46.818 --> 00:16:48.069
How's that feel?

00:16:48.153 --> 00:16:52.073
Shut up, dumbass. This is far from over.

00:16:52.157 --> 00:16:54.659
See, that's the thing.

00:16:54.743 --> 00:16:57.704
I noticed this with Sakamoto earlier, too.

00:16:57.787 --> 00:17:00.457
Those are losers' eyes.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.959
He fears death.

00:17:05.045 --> 00:17:06.921
You're just talking gibberish.

00:17:08.715 --> 00:17:12.343
You can see it in their eyes
when someone isn't prepared to face death.

00:17:12.427 --> 00:17:17.348
The harder you cling to life,
the weaker you become, you know?

00:17:17.432 --> 00:17:22.479
That pesky desire to live
delays critical split-second decisions.

00:17:22.562 --> 00:17:23.855
Just like yours did.

00:17:23.938 --> 00:17:28.651
You were petrified by the knives,
and so, you couldn't dodge both of them.

00:17:30.987 --> 00:17:32.989
You don't know anything.

00:17:33.073 --> 00:17:35.992
Mr. Sakamoto is afraid of death?

00:17:36.076 --> 00:17:37.410
Of course he is.

00:17:37.494 --> 00:17:41.831
He has to protect his family
for the rest of his life.

00:17:42.457 --> 00:17:45.752
It's the hardest mission he's ever had.

00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:49.464
People fight harder

00:17:49.547 --> 00:17:52.300
when they have something to protect!

00:17:53.051 --> 00:17:56.846
Yeah, yeah.
You're practically blind right now, right?

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.557
This desperate vibe thing is annoying.

00:17:59.641 --> 00:18:02.060
It doesn't matter if I can't see!

00:18:02.143 --> 00:18:05.313
There's only one path here, anyway.

00:18:08.066 --> 00:18:09.442
What terrible timing.

00:18:11.736 --> 00:18:13.655
Why'd he jump so low?

00:18:21.871 --> 00:18:23.832
Okay, now it's getting interesting!

00:18:23.915 --> 00:18:26.084
So? What next?

00:18:26.167 --> 00:18:27.919
Shut up!

00:18:34.008 --> 00:18:35.176
Damn it!

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.678
There's gotta be something.

00:18:36.761 --> 00:18:38.179
Some way to come out on top...

00:18:38.263 --> 00:18:40.140
- Where are they?
- That ride looks fun.

00:18:40.223 --> 00:18:41.432
I gotta contact them.

00:18:42.392 --> 00:18:44.018
Can we see Sugar Bunny soon?

00:18:53.528 --> 00:18:55.446
Popcorn's delicious.

00:19:04.038 --> 00:19:05.456
Oh, no, everyone!

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.959
Sugar Bunny is in trouble!

00:19:08.042 --> 00:19:10.295
Can we cheer for Sugar Bunny together?

00:19:12.005 --> 00:19:14.674
Well, this is unexpected.

00:19:14.757 --> 00:19:16.634
Wha-- who are you?

00:19:16.718 --> 00:19:18.178
We're in the middle of a show!

00:19:18.803 --> 00:19:20.180
Shut it.

00:19:20.263 --> 00:19:21.264
I'll kill you.

00:19:21.347 --> 00:19:22.182
Huh?

00:19:23.183 --> 00:19:24.684
Uh, Sugar Bunny?

00:19:27.437 --> 00:19:29.564
Now that I have a good view...

00:19:32.817 --> 00:19:34.110
it's time for round two.

00:19:34.736 --> 00:19:36.571
I'll smash you
