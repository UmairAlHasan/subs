WEBVTT

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:32.884
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:33.885
What's in the bag?

00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:34.886
Clothes.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:35.804
Why?

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:36.888
Let me stay over.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.226
I had a fight with my dad this morning.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:42.477
Because of Chitose?

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:44.145
Yeah.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.814
How long are you staying?

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.818
Three days, at least.

00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:52.362
It's spring holiday from tomorrow.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.114
I guess you can stay with me.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:57.075
I need to tell her in advance.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.208
Long time no see, Akasawa.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.876
Long time no see.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.129
Sorry for showing up
here as a third wheel...

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:10.046
Ouch!

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.756
I was just joking.

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.342
Sorry for the intrusion.

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:16.427
No, don't worry about it.

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.304
More people means more fun.

00:02:19.013 --> 00:02:20.807
It's only going to get
noisier with him here.

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:23.977
Don't say that.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.566
{\an8}Please sit down and have a chat.
I'll go prepare dinner.

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:37.323
You must really like her
to give her a spare key.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:38.825
Shut up.

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:41.369
It's delicious.

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:43.538
Thank you.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:48.376
{\an8}You are so lucky that you get
to taste meals like this every day, Amane.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:50.378
{\an8}I know that.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:52.755
{\an8}The dinner is great as ever.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:54.632
Thank you!

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:57.510
Well...

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:58.845
What?

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.139
No, never mind.

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:08.271
The way you look at her all dreamily...

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:09.647
And you say you don't fancy her?

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.773
Shut up.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:14.611
Well, can't expect you to
be honest with yourself.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:21.284
{\an8}Most people in class think you are
a gloomy guy with not much presence.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.870
I know that.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:28.875
They're only judging you by your looks,
not knowing the real you.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:33.546
But Shiina sees what's inside you
and gets along with you.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.216
And that makes me happy.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.970
She puts a lot of trust in you.

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:45.225
{\an8}Why don't you hear her out
and try to believe...

00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:47.268
what she has to say about you?

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.480
Is that so?

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:55.360
<i>It's not fair only Itsuki gets it!</i>

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:57.237
<i>I want to taste Mahiru's cooking too!</i>

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.615
It's no use telling me. Go ask Shiina.

00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:03.368
<i>Fine, I'll go ask her!</i>

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.287
So here I am!

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:08.206
That was fast.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.044
I couldn't wait for another second knowing
that I can have a sleepover with Mahiru.

00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:14.045
A sleepover?

00:04:14.128 --> 00:04:17.215
It's the spring holiday after all.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.717
And Mahiru didn't object.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.929
{\an8}<i>She succumbed to Chitose's pressure.</i>

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:26.724
I really look forward to
Mahiru's cooking!

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:27.767
Itsuki!

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.896
{\an8}-I missed you so much!
-Don't worry. I'm okay with it.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.649
-Were you lonely?
-I was, Chi!

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.317
Do you need help?

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.027
I'm so excited to try Mahiru's cooking.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.405
Are you making excuses to see me?

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:43.074
I guess you aren't too comfortable there.

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:45.034
Those two are too lovey-dovey.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.288
By the way, what's for lunch?

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.873
Omelet rice, Chitose said she wants it.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.836
You like eggs too, right?

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.587
Eggs are nice.

00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:00.967
{\an8}You make great egg dishes.
I'm looking forward to it.

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:05.430
What is it?

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.517
I'm happy to hear that.
But you can't say that all of a sudden...

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:11.227
What are you saying?

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.355
Never mind.

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:22.363
{\an8}And they say they're not dating.
I don't understand.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.906
{\an8}Yeah.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.832
It was delicious!

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:35.543
You sure can make anything, Shiina.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.045
A fluffy omelet!

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:42.175
<i>How did you manage to keep
the omelet shape with the creamy insides?</i>

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:45.970
Thanks to the one who
taught me how to cook.

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:50.516
Can I be as good as you
if I learn from the same teacher?

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.188
You can make decent food if you control
your curiosity and your adventurousness.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:06:00.318
Not just for when you cook,
but can't you chill out a bit in general?

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.945
You have a great model right next to you.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:06.032
I can't become like Mahiru here.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.117
It'd be suffocating.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.287
You are being rude to Shiina.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.791
But when you are at school,

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:17.543
<i>you seem bored.</i>

00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:20.546
Do I?

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:24.675
I can't be sure because we
are not in the same class.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.928
Instead of being bored,

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:30.681
I'd say you look like you are
watching everyone from far away.

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:38.564
But you look awfully cute now, Mahiru.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.691
I can see this is the real you.

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:44.195
I prefer this version of you.

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:49.408
{\an8}I think you can be more honest.

00:06:49.992 --> 00:06:52.829
{\an8}Then Amane'll be able to pamper you.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:57.875
{\an8}Amane always pampers
those he's close with.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.545
{\an8}He'll fall head over heels for you
if you depend on him.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.214
I won't!

00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:07.343
That kind of thing will never happen.

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.220
Really?

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:23.109
You can use the bathroom.

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:30.867
LOOK! MAHIRU IS SUPER CUTE

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.784
Chitose?

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.210
<i>That idiot!</i>

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.092
Chi texted me to take a picture of
you for commemorative purposes.

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:51.262
It's just a guy's photo.
That's okay, right?

00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:55.391
{\an8}Yeah, but what's the point
of taking a picture of me?

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.851
{\an8}There is a point.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.772
<i>Itsuki left the next day
after three days at my place.</i>

00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:04.734
<i>It seems he'll be staying at
Chitose's home for a day or two.</i>

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.528
Th-The teddy bear?

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.490
I saw the picture of you
with the teddy bear.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:13.367
It seems you really treasure it.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:17.163
Of course.
You gave it to me as a gift after all.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:20.458
Don't worry. I cherish it very dearly.

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.377
I pat it and clean it every day.

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:24.837
And I hug it into sleep at night...

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:27.423
Just ignore that!

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:30.510
Please forget about what I said!

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.595
{\an8}I can't forget it now.

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:34.722
{\an8}I'll feel bothered.

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:38.434
{\an8}Hugging a teddy bear into sleep
makes me sound like a child.

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:42.855
Actually, it sounds very cute
to me when I picture it.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.482
Please don't picture it.

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:47.443
{\an8}You have to tell me
something embarrassing too.

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:49.654
{\an8}It's not fair to me.

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:55.117
If you don't tell me,
I'll text Akasawa and ask him.

00:08:55.826 --> 00:08:57.828
When did you exchange contacts?

00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:01.165
Chitose told me, so I chatted with him.

00:09:01.749 --> 00:09:03.251
And yesterday he sent the picture...

00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:06.379
No, nothing!

00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:08.297
Enough of that.

00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:13.344
Hey, your phone is ringing.

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:14.845
Okay.

00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:19.767
Mahiru?

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:24.313
No, it's nothing.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.524
Please don't mind me.

00:09:36.784 --> 00:09:39.245
You are charmless,

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:41.539
just like him.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.000
There's nothing more
infuriating than that.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:48.212
It'd be better if you
resembled me a bit more.

00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.131
But you just had to be like him.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.925
Never mind.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:56.387
We won't see each other anymore
once you graduate from university.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.264
It's pointless to worry
about those things now.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:02.226
{\an8}Just mail the necessary
documents like usual.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.769
{\an8}Okay.

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:05.563
That's all.

00:10:05.646 --> 00:10:08.107
Don't bother me with anything
unnecessary anymore.

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.215
{\an8}Were you listening?

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:35.509
I'm sorry.

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.345
Who... is she?

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.098
{\an8}Sayo Shiina, my mother.

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:45.686
Just so you know, she's always been
like that, and I'm used to it.

00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:49.649
She has always hated me
ever since I was born.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:53.319
It's always been like this,
so don't worry about me.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.334
Stay with me.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:12.963
{\an8}I'm fine.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:15.841
{\an8}You don't have to worry about me.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.969
I said that because
I want to be with you.

00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:48.124
It's not an interesting topic.

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:50.042
Do you want to hear?

00:11:53.337 --> 00:11:57.007
{\an8}My parents didn't get married for love.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.343
{\an8}I'll spare you the details.

00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:03.305
{\an8}They got married simply because of
family matters and mutual interests.

00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:08.561
{\an8}They never wanted a child.

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:13.524
{\an8}I was an accident.

00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:17.111
Since my mother gave birth to me,

00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:19.697
they had no choice
but to financially support me.

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:25.453
{\an8}I don't think they had
any intention to raise me...

00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:28.289
{\an8}No intention to raise you...

00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:33.169
They almost never came home.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:38.549
Even when they did,
they saw it as a hotel.

00:12:40.217 --> 00:12:44.054
I rarely saw them since I was little.

00:12:46.682 --> 00:12:48.851
I don't remember them doing
anything typical of a parent.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.397
Those who raised me
are actually the housekeepers.

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:57.776
<i>My parents gave me money and
didn't bother with anything else.</i>

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.446
<i>And they said they don't need me.</i>

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:05.451
<i>No matter how hard I worked
and how well I behaved,</i>

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:08.245
<i>they never cared for me.</i>

00:13:08.996 --> 00:13:11.123
{\an8}They don't care about me at all.

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:14.210
<i>Even though I'm pretty,</i>

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.004
<i>good at studying, and capable of sports</i>

00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:18.005
<i>and housework,</i>

00:13:20.424 --> 00:13:23.928
<i>they never once cared for me.</i>

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.767
{\an8}I'm working so hard
even though it's all in vain.

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:31.977
{\an8}It's so foolish of me, right?

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.649
{\an8}Even though it will go unnoticed.

00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:42.530
They can't get a divorce because of me.

00:13:43.864 --> 00:13:45.741
Neither of them wants to be my guardian.

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:50.913
That's why they are waiting
for me to graduate from university.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.082
Once I'm independent,

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:55.918
I won't have any relation
to them anymore.

00:13:56.418 --> 00:13:57.253
That's...

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:02.007
When my mother told
me that I'm not wanted,

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.802
I was truly hurt.

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:10.182
{\an8}<i>I had to wallow in my despair
out in the rain on a swing.</i>

00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:17.606
{\an8}They should have never had me
if I were such a burden to them.

00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:21.193
Amane?

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:27.533
I think I understand how you
became who you are now.

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.619
Are you saying I'm not cute?

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:31.745
{\an8}No, I'm not.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.667
{\an8}I mean you are patient and
not willing to show your vulnerability.

00:14:38.502 --> 00:14:42.590
I won't discuss your family.

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:46.093
It's your family matters, after all.

00:14:47.803 --> 00:14:49.722
I'll pretend not to see.

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:51.515
So you can cry if you want.

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:54.143
{\an8}You'll feel suffocated

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:55.978
{\an8}holding all those emotions in.

00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:02.401
Will you keep it a secret for me?

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.236
What are you talking about?

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.490
Then lend me your shoulder for a moment.

00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:22.087
You looked at me after all.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.549
You were leaning against my chest.
There was nothing I could do.

00:15:26.216 --> 00:15:29.178
{\an8}I tried not to look at you
when you started crying.

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:32.932
{\an8}Amane.

00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:33.974
What?

00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:36.101
Thank you.

00:15:37.227 --> 00:15:38.812
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:15:39.813 --> 00:15:42.524
{\an8}Could you lend me
your chest one more time?

00:15:53.577 --> 00:15:55.913
What should I do from now on?

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:01.210
{\an8}They won't look at me
no matter how hard I try.

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:03.462
{\an8}It's the same with the others.

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:07.466
<i>Everybody likes the Angel, Mahiru Shiina.</i>

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.969
<i>They want to see me as the angel.</i>

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.223
{\an8}But nobody needs the real me.

00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:17.810
{\an8}I'm paying the price for my own doing...

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:19.353
{\an8}Isn't that silly?

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:24.483
The real me is not cute at all.

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:26.819
I'm timid and selfish,

00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:29.780
and I have an unpleasant personality.

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:32.741
I'm not attractive in any way.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.410
I like that somewhat.

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:39.581
There are moments when you are not cute.

00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:45.671
But more than that,
I find you cute and I want to protect you.

00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:51.719
{\an8}I like that you are forthright.

00:16:52.302 --> 00:16:55.806
You wouldn't even be worrying about
this if you were a mean person.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.350
You are too pessimistic.

00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:03.397
{\an8}Don't put yourself down.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.984
{\an8}There's a person right here who
knows the real you and still likes you.

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:17.411
{\an8}No! Chitose and the others
must feel the same way!

00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:20.539
I didn't mean anything by it.

00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:24.168
It's not just me, but my parents,
Chitose and Itsuki.

00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:27.755
We like you when you are not the angel
and we enjoy our time with you.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:31.216
{\an8}You are more... how do I put it...

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.595
{\an8}You are more pleasant than you think.

00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:38.724
Why are you crying again?

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.768
I feel fortunate.

00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:43.437
Or rather, you've been
unfortunate up until now.

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:46.190
You can be a bit more selfish.

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:49.818
Can I ask you for a favor?

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.236
Go ahead.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.073
You are the only one who can do this.

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.451
{\an8}Please watch over me.

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:00.662
{\an8}I see how hard you work.

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:03.957
{\an8}It feels like you'll disappear
once I look away.

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:05.084
{\an8}So I will.

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:07.127
{\an8}Keep me close by your side.

00:18:08.378 --> 00:18:09.588
I'll hold your hand then.

00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:13.509
{\an8}For today...

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:19.681
Please hold me with your whole body.

00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:31.652
What's wrong?

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:33.195
It's just...

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:37.699
I feel embarrassed that
you saw my pitiful appearance.

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:39.493
I don't mind that at all.

00:18:39.576 --> 00:18:41.203
But I do.

00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:43.914
You should learn how to rely on others.

00:18:44.748 --> 00:18:46.834
Because you are not alone.

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:50.420
Not alone?

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:52.047
I'm right next to you.

00:18:52.756 --> 00:18:55.217
And Itsuki, Chitose, and my parents.

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:59.596
{\an8}Don't forget there are people
who care about you.

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.058
Do you too?

00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:07.229
Do you care about me too?

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:09.982
Of course.

00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:13.986
We've been together for so long.
Of course, I care about you...

00:19:15.362 --> 00:19:16.947
I see...

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:22.828
Amane, should we take a walk outside?

00:19:29.209 --> 00:19:30.711
We're going back to school soon.

00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:34.715
Yeah, we'll change classes soon.
That's a bit of a downer.

00:19:35.382 --> 00:19:37.467
But I'm looking forward to
my new class though.

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:41.972
Because you might be
in the same class as Chitose?

00:19:57.613 --> 00:19:59.156
Mahiru...

00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:03.911
I want to thank you again, properly.

00:20:08.415 --> 00:20:11.710
I received so much from you.

00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:14.922
I didn't do anything great.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.840
But it's very important to me.

00:20:17.925 --> 00:20:21.053
I'm so lucky to have you by my side.

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:24.431
I wouldn't be able to endure it alone.

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:27.559
I see.

00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:30.896
Please keep your promise
and watch over me.

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:33.273
Don't look anywhere else.

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:34.358
Okay...

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.568
But I can't see you now.

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:38.946
I'll get mad if you look at me now.

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:41.865
That's unreasonable.

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:47.204
<i>She's making it harder
for me not to like her.</i>

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:52.834
It's spectacular.

00:20:57.756 --> 00:21:03.679
I don't really like cherry blossoms...
More exactly, I don't like spring.

00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:08.225
The entrance ceremony...
and the graduation ceremony...

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.310
I was always all alone.

00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:13.855
<i>No one held my hand.</i>

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.275
<i>No one walked with me.</i>

00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:20.946
{\an8}That's why I don't like spring.

00:21:21.905 --> 00:21:24.950
{\an8}It reminds me
how terrible it is to be alone.

00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:27.911
You have me with you now.

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:29.621
Yeah.

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:32.916
It's only me for today.
You'll have to make do.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.876
I'm not making do.

00:21:36.086 --> 00:21:36.920
Sorry.

00:21:37.587 --> 00:21:39.172
No, I didn't mean it like that.

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:43.927
I mean this is not something
like a compromise.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.680
I see...

00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:52.185
I'm glad I came here with you.

00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:59.151
I think I'm starting
to like cherry blossoms.

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:35.831
NEXT EPISODE
