WEBVTT

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.094
The Golden Week is approaching.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.056
It's going to be another long holiday.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.058
{\an8}Do you hate long holidays?

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.186
{\an8}No, I just don't know
what to do with my time.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.522
I thought you were going to teach
Chitose cooking?

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.399
That's all I have planned at the moment.

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:51.611
Right. It's nice to have a holiday,

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:53.613
but it would be boring
if there is nothing to do.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:55.907
Amane, don't you have any plans?

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.908
I am kind of free.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.411
What's wrong?

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:05.834
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT COUPON

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.086
May I use this?

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:12.090
{\an8}Ask me anything!

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:16.845
{\an8}During Golden Week,
please spend a day with me.

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:23.810
During Golden Week...

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:27.772
I want to go shopping
or hang out with you.

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.235
{\an8}Is that okay?

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.613
{\an8}I mean, even if you don't use the coupon,

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.949
{\an8}you can just ask me if
you want me to go shopping with you.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:39.659
{\an8}I want to use this coupon,

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:42.328
{\an8}so no matter what I say that day,
you're going to listen to me.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.458
Since you insist, okay then.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.169
What exactly do you want me to do?

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.923
Carry... my stuff.

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.551
Okay, I'll be at your service.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:59.387
So where do you want to go?

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.725
{\an8}I haven't decided yet.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.435
Wait, what?

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:10.148
Because I don't know
what kind of place you like.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:11.691
Me?

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:17.405
It's rare to go out together, so I want
to go somewhere we can both have fun.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.328
{\an8}Is that okay?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.380
There's a place I wanted to go.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:35.965
Where is it?

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.342
{\an8}Don't laugh at me.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:38.927
{\an8}I won't.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:40.595
A cat cafe.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:42.555
I mean...

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.682
I won't be embarrassed
if we can go together.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:46.935
{\an8}Do you not want to go?

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.687
{\an8}Yes, I want to.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:50.897
{\an8}Then...

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:52.899
Let's go together.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:53.858
Yeah.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.569
What's the plan after that?

00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:00.323
And then we'll go shopping...

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.743
I also want to go to an amusement arcade.

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:06.412
Because I've never been to one before.

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:08.289
Then let's go to all the places.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:11.626
I'm looking forward to it.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.421
{\an8}I wish the holiday would come sooner.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.675
Right.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:20.969
Yay!

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.472
The first Mahiru cooking class.

00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:25.473
Of course,

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.143
we have invited
Miss Mahiru Shiina as a teacher.

00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:32.397
You were invited to this house, okay?

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.107
And here is our food taster...

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.945
our guest, Mr. Amane Fujimiya,
who is an unmatched picky eater.

00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:40.154
Shut up.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.781
And this is my house.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.534
You're such a party pooper.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.786
Sorry to show up so early.

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:50.081
It's fine. You are making me lunch.

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:52.542
But more importantly...

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:57.046
I want you to keep an eye on Chitose
in case she adds something weird.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.423
It seems I don't have your trust.

00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:01.718
Don't forget what you did
on Valentine's Day.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.555
Oh, please. That was a prank.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.849
I'm sure I can prepare
a decent meal, probably.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.185
You don't sound so sure of yourself.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.647
I beg you to cook something I can eat.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.108
Right on! You can rest assured.

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.777
Let's get started.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:21.529
Okay.

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:23.156
What shall we do first?

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.575
Peel the shrimps first.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:26.617
Okay.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.120
If you want to easily peel off the shell,

00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:32.707
hold the shrimp with
its back facing up in both hands,

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.294
put your index finger between
the third and fourth sections of the shell

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.463
and pull it left and right.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:42.050
Amazing! It just came off.

00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:47.722
{\an8}Um...

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.016
{\an8}It tickles...

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:54.312
{\an8}Mahiru...

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:55.313
{\an8}Yes...

00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:56.481
{\an8}Good morning...

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:57.732
{\an8}Good morning.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.194
{\an8}Actually, it's time to say good afternoon.

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:06.741
When I sat next to you, you leaned on me.

00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:09.869
Uh, I'm sorry it must've bothered you.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.038
Not at all.

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:13.706
Actually, Mahiru said,

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:18.044
"Amane is asleep and acting coquettishly."
Then she let you lean on her.

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:19.337
{\an8}Chitose!

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:24.592
{\an8}So... Since when did you two start calling
each other by your first names?

00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:25.885
Chitose...

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.179
Don't glare at me like that.

00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:30.139
You should blame yourself.

00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:34.936
Did you play a trick on me
while I was asleep?

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.771
I didn't.

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:40.775
What's the matter, boy?

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.569
So you did something other than a prank.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:47.240
What? I haven't done anything.

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:48.282
Really?

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.744
Mahiru, did she do anything?

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.998
Chitose didn't do anything...

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:00.169
Everything looks delicious!

00:07:01.003 --> 00:07:02.839
Mahiru, what about the taste?

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.465
Don't worry.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.593
There's nothing weird in there
and I tried it already.

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:08.970
Good.

00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:11.681
{\an8}Why are you so suspicious of me?
I can't believe it.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.641
{\an8}I made it properly today.

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.810
Let's eat.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.402
It's good!

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.908
I wonder if Itsuki will be happy.

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:34.537
Mahiru, thank you
for teaching me how to cook.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:37.457
I had a great time, too.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.959
Thanks for having me.

00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:46.466
Um... I'm sorry...

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:49.760
about the prank.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:50.678
Prank?

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.222
Chitose really didn't do anything.

00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:55.266
But I did...

00:07:56.392 --> 00:07:57.226
You did?

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.354
{\an8}I... poked you in the cheek.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.608
{\an8}Does that count as a prank?

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.027
{\an8}Th-Then...

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:10.615
{\an8}I stared at your sleeping face
and stroked your hair.

00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:12.783
You really like that, don't you?

00:08:13.367 --> 00:08:14.243
Yes...

00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:17.413
Because your sleeping face is
so cute, I couldn't help but...

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:18.831
You couldn't help but...

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.250
{\an8}I couldn't stop poking you in the cheek.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.505
{\an8}Is it fun to poke a boy in the cheek?

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:27.548
Yes, it is.

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:29.800
{\an8}I can understand how you feel.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.638
{\an8}Your cheeks are soft
and nice to the touch.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.358
{\an8}<i>She is so naive.</i>

00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:53.908
{\an8}We're going out tomorrow.

00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:54.867
{\an8}Right.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.120
Amane.

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:00.873
Amane, I wanted to ask you...

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:04.919
{\an8}Which do you prefer,
pure style or mature style?

00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:05.878
What?

00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:13.427
Whatever suits you.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.347
{\an8}I'm asking you what you prefer.

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.641
{\an8}I don't know.

00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:27.024
{\an8}The pure style would suit your personality
and will be very cute on you.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:30.736
{\an8}If you decide to go with the mature style,
that could also accentuate your beauty.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:35.241
{\an8}How can you just say
something like that naturally?

00:09:35.324 --> 00:09:36.325
{\an8}Dear me.

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:39.120
You're the one who asked me.

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:43.833
{\an8}Then the pure style.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:45.918
{\an8}That's a deal.

00:09:47.044 --> 00:09:50.423
I'll do my best to make you feel surprised
and struggle to keep your usual calm self.

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:54.051
I don't think that would be pure style.

00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:57.430
Then I'll try to get you hooked on me.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:59.974
It bothers me if you try too hard.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:02.476
Please feel free to be bothered.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.901
{\an8}Amane, morning.

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.531
You put your hair in a bun today?

00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:18.993
{\an8}I'm afraid it'll get in the way
when I play with the cats.

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:20.911
{\an8}How is it?

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:22.413
It suits you well.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.749
It's good then.

00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:28.377
{\an8}Well... laugh if you want to.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.546
{\an8}Why do you say so suddenly?

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.673
{\an8}You must think I'm too excited.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:34.508
Not at all.

00:10:35.092 --> 00:10:37.261
I did think you were cuter than usual.

00:10:38.846 --> 00:10:43.893
{\an8}Those words come out of you so naturally.
It must be a result of good parenting.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:45.853
I guess that's true.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.649
But I mean it. Don't worry.

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:50.983
I believe you.

00:10:51.692 --> 00:10:53.361
Let's go then.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:55.988
Give me your hand.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:01.744
So cute!

00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:03.704
Look at that cat!

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.250
Cats...

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:09.460
Look!

00:11:09.543 --> 00:11:11.545
Each one of them is so cute!

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.839
Yeah, so cute.

00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:16.384
This one...

00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:18.594
Her name is Silk.

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:20.846
Silk.

00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:28.479
I don't think she hates you.

00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:30.106
She just finished saying hello.

00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:32.274
Is that so?

00:11:32.983 --> 00:11:35.027
Just let her get used to you.

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:37.905
Anyway, let's sit down.

00:11:37.988 --> 00:11:39.031
Okay.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.201
It's so cute.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:44.412
What?

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.414
It's too cute for me to drink.

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:50.376
Please don't laugh at me.

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:53.754
{\an8}No, I just thought you
worrying about that is so cute.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:55.214
{\an8}Because...

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:57.591
it would be a pity to ruin

00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:59.718
such a cute cat.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.680
It would be a pity not to drink it.

00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:14.692
Why are you laughing?

00:12:14.775 --> 00:12:18.154
You have a white beard.

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:21.240
You took a picture of me, right?

00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:23.784
I'm sorry. Do I have to delete it?

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:27.079
Are you going to keep
this embarrassing picture?

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:29.415
I couldn't resist
because you were so cute.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:33.377
{\an8}You can only keep one.

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.883
Look! It's on my lap.

00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:39.884
Great!

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:42.803
Look, it looks like
it wants to be stroked.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:43.804
Okay.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:47.725
By the way,

00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:51.562
since when did you and Silk get so close?

00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:54.190
{\an8}I don't know why
but she wanted me to pet her.

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:58.611
Is Silk your favorite now?

00:12:58.694 --> 00:13:02.281
I saw a similarity to you,
so I like to stroke her.

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:03.657
Similarity?

00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:04.575
Well,

00:13:05.075 --> 00:13:10.289
I thought you were a little hard
to get close to when I first met you.

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:13.417
But once I got close to you,
you started to become more affectionate.

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:16.212
{\an8}I'm not a cat!

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.881
{\an8}And it's not like
I get friendly with anyone.

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:22.468
After all, you're defensive.

00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:24.261
Why are you describing me as if I'm a cat?

00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:26.055
{\an8}I'm not.

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.014
{\an8}Right?

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:31.393
You are.

00:13:41.862 --> 00:13:42.988
Do you want to go inside?

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:47.326
The clothes on that mannequin
would look very nice on you.

00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:49.161
Do you like this style?

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.497
I guess so...

00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:54.375
Although you look good in anything,

00:13:54.458 --> 00:13:56.752
this type of clothes must suit you too.

00:13:57.711 --> 00:13:59.630
{\an8}I'll go try it on.

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:08.722
Are you alone?

00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:14.353
Would you like to have tea
with us if you have time?

00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:16.313
No, I'm waiting for someone.

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:19.525
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:14:21.068 --> 00:14:22.361
Excuse us!

00:14:22.444 --> 00:14:24.321
Alright, let's go!

00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:35.165
Press it.

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:36.083
Okay.

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:45.426
Mahiru, you did great!

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:49.013
May I ask... if you like to take this?

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:50.556
Is it for me?

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:53.309
After all, you gave me a present and...

00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:56.228
You seem to like Silk a lot.

00:14:58.063 --> 00:15:01.567
Or maybe you don't like plushies
because you're a boy.

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:03.152
It's not like that.

00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:07.531
You tried so hard to get it,
so it feels wrong for me to have it...

00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:10.242
{\an8}I did it for you...

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:15.456
{\an8}No, I'm not trying to
force you to take it...

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.418
Then I'll keep it in my room.

00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:22.338
Although I won't put it
by the pillow like you.

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:23.547
I mean I can't...

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:28.177
{\an8}Please forget about it...

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:30.721
I will cherish it!

00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:31.639
Shiina...

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:35.851
Kadowaki...

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.979
Uh... I wonder if I've interrupted you.

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:40.439
No, you haven't.

00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:44.068
I didn't even know you had a boyfriend.

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:47.279
We're not in such a relationship.

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:50.074
You two are clearly...

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:54.453
Fujimiya.

00:15:57.289 --> 00:16:00.501
So you two are neighbors and
have known each other since first grade.

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.921
Forget about it.

00:16:04.004 --> 00:16:06.173
As Itsuki said.

00:16:06.256 --> 00:16:07.132
What do you mean?

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:09.718
He said you'd look good
if you dressed up.

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:12.346
I think you look cool.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.516
It sounds like you're
trying to make fun of me.

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:17.101
I didn't mean to.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:21.647
{\an8}Shiina, so you knew Fujimiya
looks cool when he dresses up?

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.190
Well...

00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:24.858
Yes.

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:27.486
I think I get it.

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:29.613
You must be trying hard.

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:34.618
I didn't expect you
to be so easy to see through.

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:38.956
Well... Kadowaki...

00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:43.043
Please don't tell anyone about this.

00:16:43.752 --> 00:16:46.922
Like... the fact that
I'm very close to Amane...

00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:50.509
Don't you worry about that.

00:16:51.301 --> 00:16:54.221
I'm not interested in sharing
other people's secrets for fun.

00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:58.475
And I don't want to cut ties with
Fujimiya over some petty things.

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:00.436
After all, we're finally friends.

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:09.862
I feel so sorry.

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:12.114
Why are you suddenly apologizing?

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:15.117
Just... because we got caught by Kadowaki.

00:17:15.784 --> 00:17:17.870
That was unavoidable.

00:17:17.953 --> 00:17:20.247
And I think we settled
it down perfectly.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.875
He seemed to understand.

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:27.755
I knew that we'd inevitably be spotted
by people if we went out together.

00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:30.382
I had thought about it.

00:17:31.091 --> 00:17:33.719
Fortunately,
it was Kadowaki who caught us.

00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:35.012
He's really nice.

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:39.683
{\an8}Amane, you have a very
high appraisal of Kadowaki.

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:40.893
Yeah.

00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:44.313
The more we talk,
the more I know he is a nice guy.

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:46.732
I can understand why he is so popular.

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:48.776
He's beautiful inside and out.

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:51.779
Birds of a feather flock together.

00:17:52.362 --> 00:17:54.531
I don't know why he likes me...

00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.284
You're putting yourself down again.

00:17:57.951 --> 00:17:59.119
It's my habit.

00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:01.455
Why did you develop such a habit?

00:18:01.538 --> 00:18:02.539
Honestly...

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:06.168
{\an8}<i>The train on platform two is arriving...</i>

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.796
{\an8}It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:13.675
{\an8}But you have to remember
that I like you just the way you are.

00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:17.888
If necessary,

00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:22.017
I will praise you
until you beg me to stop.

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:23.894
So scary!

00:18:24.561 --> 00:18:28.023
I'd be so embarrassed. Please don't.

00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:31.902
{\an8}Then please be more confident.

00:18:35.572 --> 00:18:36.448
Thank you.

00:18:42.704 --> 00:18:43.539
So...

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:46.166
I wonder if you could explain
what happened yesterday.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.753
We're not in the kind
of relationship you imagine.

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:52.923
But I don't believe that's true.

00:18:53.006 --> 00:18:54.174
Hey you!

00:18:54.758 --> 00:18:59.012
You're not just getting along well.

00:18:59.888 --> 00:19:03.308
Shiina cooks for you every day.

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.352
Itsuki!

00:19:05.435 --> 00:19:07.312
You were going to get caught
sooner or later.

00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:09.064
So I might as well have told him now.

00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:12.568
What?

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:14.695
{\an8}Wife of commuter marriage?

00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:15.946
{\an8}No!

00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.947
{\an8}I live alone.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.200
{\an8}And it's easier to cook for two
and split the bill.

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:22.411
That's what he says.

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.163
Totally unconvincing.

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:25.455
Not you too...

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:30.836
{\an8}Usually girls don't go
to guys they don't like.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.590
{\an8}They wouldn't go into a boy's room
if they don't trust him.

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:35.799
Well said!

00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:39.303
Fujimiya, do you like Shiina?

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.180
Why do you ask this?

00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:48.854
I like her. Can't I?

00:19:53.233 --> 00:19:54.276
I'm back.

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:55.903
You... are back.

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.447
Did you enjoy karaoke?

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:01.033
Kadowaki asked me many questions.

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.452
That sounds rough.

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:06.205
What did you just hide?

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:10.083
I didn't exactly hide... well...

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:11.376
Would you be angry?

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.462
Did you do something
that would anger me?

00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:17.132
It depends. You might get angry...

00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:21.136
Well, tell me about it first.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:25.682
{\an8}Ms. Shihoko showed me your old pictures...

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:27.517
Is my mom an idiot?!

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:30.896
{\an8}And... there's a reason for that.

00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:33.232
<i>I was talking to Ms. Shihoko,</i>

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:35.901
<i>and we happened to be talking
about Children's Day...</i>

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:40.364
{\an8}I said you must've been cute
when you were a kid.

00:20:40.447 --> 00:20:41.782
{\an8}And then she sent a lot of...

00:20:41.865 --> 00:20:43.617
{\an8}Wait, let me check...

00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:46.536
{\an8}She didn't send anything bad, did she?

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:53.126
Miss Mahiru!

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.463
Do you want to show it to me now
or do you want me to keep pushing you,

00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:57.464
which do you want?

00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:29.579
What a weird look!

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:36.712
You pushed a girl down, touched her face
and you have the audacity to say that?

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:40.007
I'm really sorry about that.

00:21:40.507 --> 00:21:41.717
I unlocked it.

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:44.011
You can check if you want.

00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:49.933
{\an8}<i>I was this close to
being the worst guy ever.</i>

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.105
You said you wanted to check, right?

00:21:55.188 --> 00:21:56.857
Sorry, I was thinking about something.

00:21:57.899 --> 00:21:58.734
Idiot...
