WEBVTT

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.892
Do you have any plans for Mother's Day?

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:42.227
I do.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.480
I'm just going to send a gift
and some flowers back home though.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:49.984
There would be other ways
to celebrate if we lived with my mom.

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:51.861
Like doing housework?

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:55.031
I'll only make things worse
if I help with housework.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.368
I wonder why your parents
allowed you to live alone.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:02.122
You can't do any housework.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.959
Fujimiya, I'm glad to be
in the same class.

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:12.799
And I'm curious what made you decide
to live on your own.

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.845
I didn't want to stay
in my hometown for some reason.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.476
You don't need to take it too seriously.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.521
I don't want to make you
worry so much about me.

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:29.983
{\an8}It's nothing serious.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.114
{\an8}It's just that there are some people
back there I don't want to see.

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:38.616
{\an8}That's why I moved out.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.160
{\an8}It's nothing, seriously.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:41.995
{\an8}For me, it's all in the past.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.080
You are lying.

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:47.834
I'm not.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.210
Well...

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.796
You wouldn't have had
that expression if it were nothing.

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.425
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:03:00.555
But it makes me sad to see you being sad.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.767
It's not that I don't want to tell you.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:08.980
It's really not a big deal.
And it's not interesting at all.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.527
{\an8}Where should I begin?

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.113
<i>How do I put it?</i>

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:20.617
<i>I guess you can say I'm a lucky child.</i>

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.244
<i>I have parents who love me,</i>

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:25.371
<i>and I grew up in a well-off family.</i>

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.042
<i>They take a great care of me,
and I know I'm loved by them.</i>

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:33.796
<i>But I didn't realize
how lucky I was back then.</i>

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.299
<i>I trusted people around me.</i>

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.427
In a word, I was very naive.

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:45.767
{\an8}It must have been very easy to trick
and use such a naive person.

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.103
Fujimiya is making me laugh my head off.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:52.607
With that mediocre looks,
he thinks he's popular.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.277
Don't speak ill of him.
He's been treating us all the time.

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:59.530
Cause that's the only thing he can do.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:00.448
That's right.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:04.661
<i>And...</i>

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:08.957
I caught them saying nasty things
about me behind my back.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:12.794
Hey.

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:15.755
Don't you think that's a bit
over the line even as friends?

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:16.881
Huh?

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.258
What are you talking about?

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.634
From the start,

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.011
you are just a walking wallet to us.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:28.226
Of course I knew
not everyone is like them.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:34.649
{\an8}I knew some people wanted to be my friends
because they liked my personality.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:38.278
<i>But I felt afraid
once I started to suspect them.</i>

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.863
<i>I couldn't trust anyone anymore.</i>

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.325
So I left my hometown.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:50.290
I wanted to move to a place
where no one knows me and start again.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.751
{\an8}If I were there,

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:56.921
{\an8}I would slap those guys so hard.

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.260
No, your hand would get hurt if you did.

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:08.182
I don't feel as bad as you do.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.517
You don't need to be upset.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.269
Amane.

00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:13.771
Feelings cannot be compared.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.440
And I don't want it to be compared.

00:05:18.776 --> 00:05:22.405
You sadness belongs only to you.

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:25.158
You can't compare it with mine.

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:32.915
{\an8}All I can do is to accept your pain

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.043
{\an8}and support you.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.421
Just like how you supported me.

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:42.759
I want to support you
and I want you to rely on me.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.927
I'm relying on you everyday.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.597
I mean mentally.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.891
I'm relying on you mentally too.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:51.476
Then please rely on me more.

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.519
You don't want to spoil me.

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:55.938
I can never spoil you enough.

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.024
You'll make me a spoiled loser.

00:05:58.107 --> 00:06:00.193
Are you saying that now?

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:03.738
I've always known you are spoiled.

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:05.990
But...

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:09.202
I also know that you are kind and patient.

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:12.872
{\an8}You can always depend on me.

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:17.210
{\an8}I'm fine really.

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:21.297
{\an8}Don't play tough with me, you silly.

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:26.719
Shut up and just let me spoil you.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.972
You are so persistent.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.516
You just noticed?

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.353
Girls can be persistent sometimes.

00:06:36.687 --> 00:06:40.399
{\an8}I always return the favors.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:45.029
<i>I relied on you last time</i>

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.490
<i>and I acted like a child to you.</i>

00:06:48.866 --> 00:06:50.952
{\an8}It's my turn now.

00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:52.703
{\an8}Please let me spoil you like a child.

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.372
{\an8}I'm returning the favor now.

00:06:55.706 --> 00:06:57.041
{\an8}This is more than I gave you.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.044
{\an8}Then you owe me a favor.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:03.965
If I feel down one day,

00:07:04.048 --> 00:07:06.551
it'll be enough if you are
there to support me.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.276
Don't do something like this again.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:27.113
But I don't want to see you sad.

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:29.824
So please come to me earlier next time.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.493
That's a bit...

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.621
{\an8}Why did you look away?

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.040
{\an8}You shouldn't allow me
to act like a child.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.877
{\an8}I'm a guy... after all...

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:42.837
{\an8}I know that.

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:46.299
You don't understand at all.

00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:48.801
You are the one who doesn't understand.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.303
What do you mean?

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:53.264
You don't understand anything, silly.

00:07:55.057 --> 00:07:58.019
I wouldn't let anyone
other than you do that.

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:06.527
{\an8}What's wrong?

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.362
{\an8}Hugging you from your front is fine.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:09.822
{\an8}But you're startled by a back hug?

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.451
{\an8}Anyone would get startled
if you do it so suddenly.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.120
You said yourself I can come to you.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.122
Don't turn around.

00:08:20.124 --> 00:08:21.000
{\an8}Idiot.

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.462
{\an8}<i>I am an idiot.</i>

00:08:25.713 --> 00:08:27.507
I'm a sly person.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.925
I know you'd accept me,

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.176
that's why I'm relying on you.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.179
You've always been a sly one.

00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:36.224
Sorry about that.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:39.560
If you're going to be sly,
you can be slyer.

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:42.271
{\an8}I'm a sly person as well.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.066
{\an8}I have no right to complain about you.

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:47.610
You are sly? How?

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.111
You can't tell?

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:54.200
If you haven't realized I'm sly,

00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:56.285
then you still have way more to learn.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.589
<i>Mahiru is an idiot too.</i>

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:11.008
Silly girl.

00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:22.728
<i>I need to work harder</i>

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:26.440
<i>until I can feel confident
to stand next to her.</i>

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.902
I wanted to ask you something, Shiina.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.196
What is it?

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:33.864
Uh...

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:39.078
Someone saw you walking with a guy
at the shopping mall.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.623
Yes, I did.

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.378
So...

00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:49.255
What's your relationship with that guy?

00:09:50.464 --> 00:09:52.550
Relationship...

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:56.012
I guess you can say we are friends.

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:57.013
Friends?

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:01.475
So it wasn't a date?

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.477
A date?

00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:06.230
{\an8}Well.

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:09.358
{\an8}Considering the definition of a date,
you can call it a date.

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:15.323
What do you mean by that?

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.492
{\an8}We are not a couple.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.245
But for me,

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:23.789
he's the most important person to me.

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:27.752
I wasn't lying.

00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:32.048
Even though we've only
been together for half a year,

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:36.510
it really was a great time for me.

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:41.223
I've never involved with
anyone so deeply before.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:45.269
So you are the one closest to me
and whom I like the most.

00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:49.065
{\an8}For me, the world is very small.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:53.194
{\an8}I can count the people
I like with one hand.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:59.867
{\an8}And among those people, you are
the closest and most important one to me.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:03.871
You told me I could just be myself.

00:11:03.954 --> 00:11:05.247
Mahiru...

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:09.960
So please have more confidence.

00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:19.428
You know you are the one I trust the most.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:23.974
But you should know that what you said
could cause some misunderstandings.

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:27.436
I did it on purpose.

00:11:28.145 --> 00:11:33.859
People would start to imagine things
if I just brushed it off.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.736
That is true.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.323
Giving them some information

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.409
makes it easier to control the rumors.

00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:44.703
Is that so?

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:49.208
But you should've told me beforehand,
so I wouldn't misunderstand.

00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:51.460
{\an8}Misunderstand?

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:58.634
If I said that you were very important
to me, you'd overthink too, wouldn't you?

00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:04.223
I don't think you'll tell anyone
in the first place.

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:06.267
I guess you are right.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.769
{\an8}Or, are you willing to make it public?

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:15.443
It's kind of annoying to be popular.

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:18.696
People keep their eyes on
your relationship and even have a say.

00:12:19.363 --> 00:12:23.075
But it's just you and me here.
No one will say anything.

00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:26.203
So I'll overlook it for now.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.458
Exercising?

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:32.042
You?

00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:35.212
So I'll go out more often.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.714
{\an8}That's sudden.

00:12:36.797 --> 00:12:39.717
{\an8}Exercising is good, of course. But why?

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:45.598
{\an8}I just think I need to
toughen up as a guy.

00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:51.312
{\an8}Wow. I never expected you to say that,
considering the way you lived.

00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:55.566
{\an8}You might get tired doing
something you're not used to.

00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:57.401
{\an8}Should I comfort you beforehand?

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:58.986
Stop it.

00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:04.450
I can do it anytime if you want it.

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:08.370
It's like you're willing to do
anything I want. That's scary.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:12.666
As long as it's within my power.
But I will ask for a return of favor.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.920
What will that be?

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:22.176
I have some requests too.

00:13:22.259 --> 00:13:24.470
As long as it's within my power.

00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:25.930
This is a so-called fair exchange.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.432
{\an8}But I'm greedier than you.

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:31.685
{\an8}Then just go ahead and ask me.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.108
I wanted to ask you...

00:13:40.277 --> 00:13:42.780
To come...

00:13:42.863 --> 00:13:44.240
Come...

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:46.867
Please pat my head.

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.369
That's all?

00:13:48.452 --> 00:13:49.370
Yes.

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:57.002
{\an8}I like being touched by you.

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:13.018
I like you.

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:21.318
Please touch me more.

00:14:35.499 --> 00:14:36.959
{\an8}<i>This is the worst.</i>

00:14:40.796 --> 00:14:42.047
I can't stand myself.

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:43.924
Amane.

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:47.219
Why do you look so dead?

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:52.766
No reason.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.894
I just went running in the morning.

00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:56.979
{\an8}No wonder you are tired.

00:14:57.062 --> 00:15:00.983
{\an8}This happens when someone
suddenly starts to do exercises.

00:15:01.817 --> 00:15:03.569
If you don't feel well,

00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:07.448
you should go straight home
and rest after school.

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:11.535
Thank you, but I'm fine.

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:19.960
Are you mad?

00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:21.837
I'm not.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.675
{\an8}It means you are mad
when you answer like that.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:30.387
{\an8}Did I do anything wrong?

00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:34.350
No, it's not because of you.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.727
I should apologize for making you upset.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:40.439
Then why are you so cold today?

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:44.109
No... just...

00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:46.403
For some reason...

00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:50.199
Are you annoyed at me now?

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:52.618
I would never.

00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:55.579
It's a personal issue, I should say.

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:58.332
Just something on my mind.

00:15:58.415 --> 00:16:00.250
You can't tell me?

00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:03.921
{\an8}<i>How can I explain something like that?</i>

00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:08.384
I was seducing you?

00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:10.970
I am really sorry!

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:14.640
I've always been careful
not to see you in that way.

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:19.186
How did I do it in your dream?

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.855
Is this some kind of erotic humiliation?

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:24.858
{\an8}Humiliation?

00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:25.859
{\an8}No.

00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:28.654
{\an8}It's just that if it even
got you so embarrassed,

00:16:28.737 --> 00:16:30.990
{\an8}I want to use it
as a reference for later on.

00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:32.950
No, you don't have to do that.

00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:35.160
And what are you
taking it as reference for?

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.330
When I want to make your heart race.

00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:40.958
It's bad for my heart. Please don't.

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:44.503
{\an8}You are actually more...

00:16:44.586 --> 00:16:49.508
{\an8}I should say, you are the most
innocent one among all the boys I know.

00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:52.094
{\an8}Shut up. The same goes for you.

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:57.224
{\an8}I never thought of interacting with guys.

00:16:57.307 --> 00:16:59.935
{\an8}And you are the only one so close to me.

00:17:01.228 --> 00:17:03.856
I haven't really interacted
with girls either.

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:07.359
Anyway, I found out some good news today.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:09.069
Good news?

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:13.449
I'm the first girl
you've ever interacted with.

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:15.826
That's...

00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:19.413
No, it's not wrong,
but it sounds so wrong.

00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:21.248
{\an8}What's wrong with that?

00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:23.542
{\an8}I'm the same.
It's my first time as well.

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:25.878
F... First time...

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:28.672
Amane.

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:30.883
I'm fine. Please don't look at me.

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:33.218
Why did you say please?

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:34.178
Just don't look at me.

00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:37.347
Then I won't.

00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:41.101
I'm not looking now.

00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:43.270
You're right.

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:47.858
You avoided me all day long.
Just endure it now.

00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:52.780
-Seriously?
-Exams again?

00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:54.865
It sucks.

00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:57.367
What kind of crappy schedule is that?

00:17:58.035 --> 00:17:59.119
Mahiru.

00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:02.706
Itsuki and Kadowaki will come here
to study together tomorrow morning.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.707
Is that okay?

00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:05.667
Sure.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:08.712
Shall I prepare food for the three of you?

00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:11.048
You don't need to...

00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:14.259
I just need to cook more. It's alright.

00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:16.386
By the way,

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.430
can I join the group?

00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:20.974
They said as long as you want to.

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:23.727
Should we invite Chitose?

00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:26.271
I already did.

00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:30.192
Save me, Mahiru!

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:34.321
My dad will be so mad
if I don't do well this time.

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:37.449
That's what she said.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:41.120
We agreed to study together tomorrow.

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:43.872
She definitely did it on purpose.

00:18:44.998 --> 00:18:48.502
You are working hard for the next exam.

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:52.256
Well... I want to boost my confidence.

00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:54.967
I hope I can get into the top ten.

00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:59.930
I see. Should I give you
a little more motivation?

00:19:00.013 --> 00:19:00.973
Motivation?

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:05.936
If you get into the top ten,
I'll grant your wish.

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:12.234
Even something you usually never ask me.

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:17.072
What if I ask you to do
something dangerous?

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:19.366
Depends on what you ask.

00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:23.704
But I'd probably just say to myself that
you are a guy after all, and do that.

00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:29.543
Then let me lie on your lap
like last time.

00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:38.510
No problem.

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:40.846
I'll clean your ears too.

00:19:40.929 --> 00:19:42.764
Just enjoy it.

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:45.350
Excuse me.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.311
Welcome.

00:19:47.394 --> 00:19:48.312
Where is Mahiru?

00:19:49.062 --> 00:19:51.231
She's in the kitchen preparing lunch.

00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:53.567
Mahiru.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:54.985
Welcome.

00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:56.862
Sorry to bother you.

00:19:57.362 --> 00:19:59.072
What's wrong?

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:00.282
Nothing.

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:04.453
I'm just surprised that Shiina's
staying in your home so naturally.

00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:09.374
I need her help with meals after all.

00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:12.127
So...

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:15.547
What don't you understand, Chitose?

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:16.632
All of it.

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:18.508
All... of it?

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:22.221
Itsuki needs to
get his attitude right for this.

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:25.724
You can't laugh your way out of this.

00:20:25.807 --> 00:20:28.560
Yuta, Amane is so strict.

00:20:29.144 --> 00:20:31.355
Itsuki, you should get serious about this.

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:33.607
All right.

00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:53.502
Well done.

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:55.254
Thank you.

00:20:56.129 --> 00:20:59.424
You are the type who likes
to give to others, right?

00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:01.969
I only give to the one I want to.

00:21:03.887 --> 00:21:05.389
What do you mean?

00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:07.474
{\an8}What do you think I mean?

00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:13.522
Like you can't leave a loser
who can't sort out his own life?

00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:14.898
Yeah.

00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:19.111
{\an8}You won't be able to live without me.

00:21:20.153 --> 00:21:22.030
That's absolutely correct.

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:27.160
{\an8}It's okay,
because I like taking care of you.

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:32.040
<i>She'll spoil me rotten</i>

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:35.252
<i>and make me unable to live without her.</i>

00:21:48.598 --> 00:21:51.476
I will spoil you rotten
with all my might.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.688
So, just accept it.

00:23:30.992 --> 00:23:35.831
