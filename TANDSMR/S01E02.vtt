WEBVTT

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.980
What the heck are you doing here?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.190
Nothing at all.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.260
If it's nothing, you wouldn't be sitting
here looking like you lost your way.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.420
Did something happen?

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.070
Not really.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.710
There's hair all over your uniform.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.870
Were you playing with a
dog or cat or something?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.710
I wasn't playing! I just...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.100
I wanted to rescue a cat
that was stuck in this tree.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.390
Oh, so that's what happened.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.200
Stay right there. Don't you dare move.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.490
Crus—

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.490
Easy to tear by hand

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.490
Surgical Tape

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.490
...for cuts and scratches...

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.490
World-Famous...

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.490
Shiina. Take off your tights.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.460
Huh?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.550
Come on, don't look at me like that.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.210
Here. You can use my jacket and I'll
turn around, so take off your tights.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.960
After we ice your injury,
I'll put a compress on it.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.170
How could you tell?

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.780
Because you have one shoe half off
and you haven't tried to stand up.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.350
Spraining your foot while saving a cat.
What a cliché story.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.920
Oh, you be quiet!

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.020
Fine, fine.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.850
Go on. Take off your tights
and let me see your foot.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.160
Surgical

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.160
...with World-Famous Water

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.160
Crushed

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.670
Does it feel any better?

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.620
Well, a little bit.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.300
Okay, I'll put the compress on.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.240
Don't get mad and call me
a pervert or anything.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.840
I would never say something
that rude to my rescuer!

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.850
That's a relief.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.320
You're surprisingly good at that.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.690
Yeah, I can treat minor injuries.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.100
Can't cook, though.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.530
That should be good.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.900
Math

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.860
Yes?

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.860
Look at your foot.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.240
I don't think you can wear tights
on top of a compress.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.470
Don't worry, they're clean.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.420
Here, this too.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.070
Huh?

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.510
You want people to see you
getting carried around?

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.810
Excuse me?

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.600
Sorry about this.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.650
It's no trouble.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.390
Even I'm enough of a gentleman

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.770
that I wouldn't abandon an
injured person or make them walk.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.030
Thank you very much for today.
You really saved me.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.160
No problem.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.890
Okay, take care.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.870
Fujimiya

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.410
Oh...

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.280
Hey, Amane...

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.050
Were you always so hot-blooded
that you wore shorts all year?

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.840
Oh, come on. I forgot my sweats.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.810
What a derp!

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.790
Shove it.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.730
Next!

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.160
Kadowaki-kun, go for it!

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.620
Our prince!

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.120
The prince is as popular as always.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.000
He just waved at me!

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.640
Yeah, I guess.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.240
You don't seem to care much.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.620
No. For classmates, we've barely even talked.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.290
Damn it.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.820
That jerk.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.750
But "prince" and "angel" and all that...

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.430
Our school sure has some
embarrassing nickn—

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.280
See that? The angel just smiled at me!

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.960
No, at me!

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.930
Yes! I'll show Shiina-san what I'm made of!

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.860
Thank you for your help yesterday.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.900
Here's your meal and the clothes you lent me.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.110
How are you feeling?

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.910
The pain is already mostly gone.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.740
But I'm avoiding exercise
until I recover fully.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.950
You're still a super popular angel, though.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.640
Huh?

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.100
That one little smile
lit a fire under those guys.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.420
I asked you to please stop calling me that!

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.050
But that was bewildering to me, too.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.880
Does it really make them that happy?

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.470
Yeah, most guys would freak out
if a beautiful girl smiled at them.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.460
Girls, too, right? They were squealing
after Kadowaki waved at them.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.260
Kadowaki?

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.610
Oh, that very popular person?

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.900
You're not at all interested in him?

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.100
Not really.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.490
Different class and all that.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.490
Huh. Is that how it works?

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.910
If looking good is all it takes
for other people to develop feelings,

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.540
then shouldn't you
develop feelings for me, too?

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.120
So you're aware of how cute you are.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.100
It'd be impossible to ignore
the way everyone fawns over me.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.560
Also, objectively speaking,
I know I have good features,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.800
and I've never neglected my appearance.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.240
Quite so.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.280
Today's looks special!

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.640
That's for helping me out.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.400
You really didn't have to...

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.770
There's korokke?! Did you make it?

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.840
I did.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.720
Please reheat it in the
microwave before you eat.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.780
Thank you!

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.910
But, you know... I'd love to eat it
freshly made sometime.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.950
Are you trying to come over?

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.890
Huh?

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.520
Ah, that's not what I meant!

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.060
I wouldn't be that pushy when you've
been kind enough to share with me.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.670
Let's split it.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.880
If we split the cost, and I can cook
at your place, I'll consider it.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.630
Huh?

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.080
Oh...

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.870
Splitting the cost would
actually be ideal for me, too,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.690
especially since I've been
mooching off of you all this time.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.690
But aren't you afraid for your safety?

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.780
If you dare make a move,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.290
I'll crush them. Literally.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.050
They'll never work again.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.790
Oh, god! You terrified them into hiding!

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.670
You understand the risk now,
so I doubt you'll try anything.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.670
And I believe you understand
the position I hold at school, too.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.880
If I tried anything, I'd get pulverized.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.050
Another thing...

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:14.680
What is it?

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.760
I don't think I'm your type anyway.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.730
What if you had been my type?

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.700
Then you'd probably be
pestering me all the time.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.330
And then I would have
stayed far away from you.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.490
So I guess I made the grade.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.950
Well, I can at least acknowledge
that you're not a threat.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.330
That's good to know.

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:45.000
In order for Shiina to cook at my place,
we decided on a few conditions.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.570
In addition to paying
half the cost of the ingredients,

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.020
I pay her a little extra for the labor.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.180
Fujimiya

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.590
If we have other plans
and can't eat together,

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.310
we let each other know one day ahead.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.910
And we share the work
of shopping and cleaning up.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.530
They look brand new,
like they've never been used before.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.360
Shut up.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.360
I took the liberty of selecting the menu
myself today. Is that all right?

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.160
As long as it's edible,
I'm good with anything.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:26.300
I'm going to start cooking now,
so please go wait in the living room.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.300
Will do.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.700
I know there's nothing I can help with.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.550
You're certainly taking this gracefully.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.720
Since you can't cook, I wouldn't want
you hovering over me anyway.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.970
You sure don't mince words.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.640
Because it's the truth.
There's no reason to pretend otherwise.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.240
Why do I feel like I've found my wife?

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.490
You aren't thinking something gross, are you?

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.500
Q-Quit imagining weird stuff!

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.500
Thank you for waiting.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.920
Please help yourself.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.420
Wow, it looks delicious!

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.570
Thank you for saying that.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.230
Please begin, before it gets cold.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.080
Thank you for the food.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.770
It's great!

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.270
Thank you very much.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.750
You certainly seem to be enjoying it.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.450
Because it's honestly delicious.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.930
It's good to show
appreciation for delicious food.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.300
Yes, I guess so...

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.150
Also, instead of eating in silence,

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.050
wouldn't we both feel better
if I'm up front about how good it is?

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.020
I think you're right.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.640
Fujimiya-san?

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.540
Ahh! No, it's nothing.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.550
Thank you very much.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.370
You are very welcome.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.900
It was delicious.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.600
I could tell by looking at you.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.880
But it almost feels too good to be true.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.960
Is it really okay for me to dine
with you like this every day?

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.590
If it wasn't, I wouldn't have suggested it.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.010
Even so, is it normal to cook
for a guy you don't even like?

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.640
I do it because you have
such an unhealthy lifestyle!

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.860
Also, I just really like cooking,

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.150
and I don't mind watching you eat
since you seem to enjoy it so much.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.660
Yeah, but still...

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:03.370
If it bothers you that much,
I don't need to cook.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.030
No! Please keep cooking!

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.150
Then please accept it openly.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.770
Sure.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:24.970
The Angel Next Door
Spoils Me Rotten

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.530
All right, time's up.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.390
Pass your tests up from the back.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.930
It's over, it's over!

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:34.860
Oh, man...

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.580
That was too hard!

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.520
Amane! How'd you do?

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.620
Normal.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.990
Not great, not horrible.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.410
But you still managed to squeeze into
the top 30 scores. You intellectual, you.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.540
That's because I'm not always
so busy flirting that I forget to study.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.610
Having a girlfriend is great, though!

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:54.730
Yeah, sure.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.460
You're such a bland guy.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.150
I bet you'd change
if you met a girl you like.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.590
Ikkun!

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.310
Oh, Chi!

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:04.730
Let's go home!

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.770
You're really shameless with the PDA.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.590
Patting your cute girlfriend's
head is totally normal.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.230
That's beyond comprehension.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:22.380
Nah, nah. You're the type of guy who
would totally dote on his girlfriend.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.960
Huh? What?!

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.400
Amane has a girlfriend?!

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.020
No way.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.820
Aww, why not?

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.410
If you did, I'd wanna be close friends.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.050
Your friendship gets a little too close.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.340
I'd feel bad for my imaginary girlfriend.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.380
What?! You have an imaginary girlfriend?!

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.510
We were talking about if I got one...

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.260
Thank you for washing the dishes.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:51.930
Sure.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.720
What are you doing there?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.350
I'm grading.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.520
Well, I can see that.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.750
So what's your score?

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.960
As long as my essay is right,
it should be perfect.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.900
Why am I not surprised?

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.420
I like studying well enough.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:13.760
And I've studied ahead and already
covered next year's curriculum.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.440
Yikes! That's crazy.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.790
Nice work.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.630
But you do a decent amount of
studying, too, don't you, Fujimiya-san?

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.340
Did you see my scores?

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:28.010
I can more or less remember the people who
rank high enough to have their names posted.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:32.740
Well, that's one condition for me
living alone. Maintaining my grades.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.140
I study enough to stay out of trouble,
but not as much as you.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.840
You sure work hard.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.730
I work hard because I have to.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.530
It's about time for me to be on my way.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.960
Yeah.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:00.670
Hey!

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.210
Full Name

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.210
Date of Birth

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.210
December 6

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.670
Here. You dropped it.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.210
Student ID

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.540
Oh, sorry for the trouble.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.410
Well then, have a good night.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.040
Good night.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.420
Her birthday is in four days.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.270
Huh?

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.740
I just mean, is there anything you want?

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.150
Why ask all of a sudden?

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:34.070
Well, you don't seem to need
a lot of things. I was just curious.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.100
So blunt again...

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.700
Hmm. Let me think.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.460
What do I need...

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.570
What I want is...

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:45.290
Oh!

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.710
Sharpening Stone

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.710
A sharpening stone.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.300
Sharpening stone?!

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:54.270
I already have several, but I want
one with a finer grit, you know?

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.720
Are you really a high school girl?!

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.600
Please don't expect me to behave
like a typical high school girl.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.520
A high school girl who sharpens knives?
How could this be?

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.210
I guess I'm a rare find. Lucky for you.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.130
Good morning.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.360
Yeah, good morning.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.610
Hmm. A birthday present?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.440
You know, it's important to do
research into that sort of thing.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.300
It's the key to a good
relationship. Really is.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.330
I told you, she isn't my girlfriend.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.980
Well, it depends on how close you are,

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.170
but trinkets and consumables
are usually safe.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.700
That makes sense.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.550
Also, hand cream never fails to please.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:39.640
It's pretty useful at any age
and it doesn't go bad quickly.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.750
Hand cream, huh?

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.320
What's that, what's that?

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.250
A birthday present?
You're giving it to a girl, right?

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.580
Tell me all about her!

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.380
She's a female acquaintance
of mine who's relatively young.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.200
Beyond that, I exercise
my right to remain silent.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.240
But you know, if I have no clue
about her style or personality,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.290
I can't give you helpful advice.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.460
Just go with your instincts.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.210
What gift do you think
would make a girl happy?

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.210
Fine, I can see you don't want to tell.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:16.750
Hmm. What would be good?

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.050
I don't know what kind of
relationship you have,

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.290
but for an acquaintance
you're fine talking to...

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.820
If you want something casual,

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.560
you could try candy or a handkerchief
or a bag or something small.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.920
If you gave me some kind of fancy accessory,

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.160
I'd think, "What is this? A bribe?" Probably.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.200
What would I ever bribe you for?

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.020
So, small trinkets and
things are probably safe.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.660
Also, cute stuff, you know?

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.760
Like stuffed animals.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.200
Stuffed animals?

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.340
Oh? You like that one?

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.880
But a guy my age carrying
a stuffed animal to the counter...

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.840
Don't be a coward!

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.300
Chitose.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.100
Would you...

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.600
Would I?

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.820
Please come shopping with me?!

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.230
Well, I don't know...

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.080
Please. I'm begging you!

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.690
Hmm... I guess I could go along with you.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.210
By the way, Amane-kun, I'm kinda
in the mood for something sweet.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.810
Crêpes?

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.800
Please allow me to treat you!

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.020
Yeah, sure! I'll order the deluxe one!

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:56.790
For you.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.720
What's all this about?

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.910
It's your birthday, isn't it?

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.480
It is, but...

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.990
Would you mind explaining how you knew?

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.120
I don't believe I've told anybody at all.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.680
Your school ID.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.140
Remember how you dropped it the other day?

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:13.840
Oh.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.860
You should have just ignored it.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.050
I never celebrate my birthday anyway.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.220
Fine, then.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.320
Then take it as a token of gratitude.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.270
Let's just say I thought
that I owed you something.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.540
Is it all right if I open it?

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.760
I'm sorry it isn't anything special,

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.750
but you do all that housework for me,

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.320
and this looks like it's
really good for the hands.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.210
That's very practical.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.270
I think it's safe to say you usually
lean toward practical things.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.010
I think you're right. Thank you very much.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.220
But there's something else in the bag.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:23.320
That's just, you know,
a bonus item I picked out on a whim.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.000
A bear?

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.050
So, if you don't like it,
you can get rid of it.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.120
I would never do that!

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.700
O-Oh.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.580
Yeah, that doesn't sound
like something you'd do.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.610
I would never do something so cruel.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.760
I'll cherish it.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.450
I shouldn't have looked!

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:56.980
Damn it.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.510
I've never received something
like this before.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.340
Huh?

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.480
But girls as popular as you
usually get buried in gifts.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.820
Do you really think of me like...

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.940
I've never told anyone my birthday.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.740
Because I hate birthdays.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:22.200
Normally, I get nervous about receiving
presents and things from strangers

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.630
and people I don't know well,
so I don't accept them.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.840
But you're accepting this.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.600
Because, Fujimiya-san, you're not a stranger.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.470
Patting your cute girlfriend's
head is totally normal.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.660
What is it?

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.660
No, it's nothing.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.580
That was close!

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.460
Thank you very much, Fujimiya-san.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.010
Dinner with the Angel

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.980
Next Time
