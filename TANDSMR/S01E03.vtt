WEBVTT

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.640
The Angel Next Door
Spoils Me Rotten

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.970
Amane!

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.110
I know you're there!

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.780
Amane!

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.490
There you are, Amane. Don't you look well?

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.740
Yeah, yeah. I'm very well,
so will you leave now?

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.280
Wow, what a way to talk to your mother.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.930
It took me hours to come
all the way here, you know.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.750
Fujimiya

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.420
Show a little appreciation!

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.760
Thank you very much for
traveling such a long distance.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.260
Now leave.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.990
My!

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.520
Unlike Shuto-san, you have
absolutely no charm.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.770
Guys don't need charm anyway.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.200
A rebellious phase, huh?

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.900
Well then, please excuse me.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.990
Wait a second.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.020
Nobody said...

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.280
You realize Shuto-san's and my income
is what pays the rent here?

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.030
Fujimiya

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.980
Excuse me, please.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.040
Reward for the Angel

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.040
Listen, Mom.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.300
If you're coming over, at least
tell me first. Like an adult.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.550
I have to catch you off guard to make sure
you're actually taking care of yourself.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.240
B-But I'm okay, right?

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.210
The place is clean, too.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.550
It sure is. What a surprise.
Very unexpected.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.730
And your skin is glowing, so you
must be getting enough nutrition.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.730
Y-Yeah.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.120
Oh, no.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.520
Amane! I know you're there!

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.860
Sorry! Will you go to my
room for a while? Please.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.860
Amane!

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.920
Amane!

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.590
O-Okay.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.430
Amane!

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.000
Also, I'll give you this.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.000
Amane! I know you can hear me!

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.670
I'll find a way to drag my mom outside.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.750
Amane!

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.250
Hurry and open up! Amane?

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.250
When I do, go back to your place.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.480
It looks like you've been cooking, too.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.660
Oh? Dishes for two?

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.380
Yeah, I had a friend over.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.670
Hmm...

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.770
Maybe I'll check your bedroom next.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.770
I know you're my mother, but I prefer
to keep my bedroom private.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.710
Oh, yeah? Do you have something
embarrassing in there?

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.050
Think about it.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.180
A high school boy is
going to have one or two

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.530
embarrassing things in his bedroom!

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.990
Amane.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.660
Y-Yes?

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.160
What are you hiding from me?

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.540
It's none of your business, Mom.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.060
Of course you'd say something like that.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.040
In that case...

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.260
Huh?

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.070
Amane! You little devil, you!

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.280
You've got such an adorable girlfriend!

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.200
I can't leave you alone for a second!

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.620
N-No way! She isn't
my girlfriend or anything!

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.580
Oh, my. You don't need to make excuses to me!

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.290
As your mother, I'll support
anyone you choose, Amane.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.600
But you're getting it—

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.190
Wrong? How?

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.220
You wouldn't invite a girl
over unless you liked her.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.220
And a girl wouldn't go in a boy's
room unless she liked him, too.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.730
Well, I guess I do like her.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.000
I like her as a friend.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.230
Don't try to turn all opposite-sex
friendships into something romantic.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.090
I know she doesn't
think of it that way either.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.110
If you get the wrong idea—

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.010
Oh.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.530
Hmm?

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.670
Sh-Shiina.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.210
There's been a misunderstanding.
Could you help me explain?

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.390
Misunderstanding?

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.160
Hey, hey, Miss Girlfriend. What's your name?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.090
Huh?!

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.360
U-Um, I'm Mahiru Shiina.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.710
Aww, Mahiru-chan? What an adorable name!

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.770
I'm Shihoko. Feel free
to call me by my first name, too.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.190
S-Sure.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.480
U-Um, Amane's Mother...

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.830
Oh, my! You accept me as a mother already?

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.080
Fujimiya-san!

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.460
"Fujimiya" could mean me or Amane.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.540
Right, Amane?

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.880
Eh? Mom, you're making Shiina nervous.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.000
Amane.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.300
You have to call your girlfriend
by her first name, you know.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.640
U-Um, Shihoko-san?

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.590
What, darling?

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.600
Fujimiya-san and I—

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.520
But which one do you mean?

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.620
A-Amane-kun and I don't have
that kind of relationship.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.360
Oh, dear! So I guess
things are still developing!

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.080
Huh? Um, that isn't what I...

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.080
Oh, silly me!

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.780
Did I accidentally spoil the mood here?

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.480
U-Um...

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.120
I must insist that you allow me to explain!

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.120
Yes, ma'am.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.310
Amane... kun lets me eat dinner with him.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.900
Amane-kun can't cook for himself, so...

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.220
If that's why, then I'd love for you
to keep supporting him, Mahiru-chan!

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.560
N-No, I mean...

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.350
Give it up, Shiina.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.770
Once Mom gets worked up, she stops listening.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.270
Oh, no!

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.150
Really?

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.310
Not just cooking, but cleaning, too?

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.240
Does that mean you two are living together?

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.640
How did you come up with that?!

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.080
She lives next door!

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.230
Oh, my. So you were destined to meet!

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.480
I'm so happy for you, Amane!

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.960
Such a beautiful and well-rounded girl
tending to your every need!

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.380
I don't deny that she's beautiful
and classy, but "destined to meet"?!

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.470
Mahiru-chan, as a parent
I may not be perfectly objective,

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.260
but while Amane has a mouth on him
and is pretty stubborn,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.530
he can still be sincere and gentlemanly,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.430
so I think it's fair to say
you scored a real prize.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.980
O-Oh.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.370
Well, he does have
zero experience with girls,

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.530
so it's probably best if you
take the reins there, Mahiru-chan.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.240
Mom, what are you talking about?!
Seriously, shut up!

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.340
Just go home already!

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.150
Well, if you insist.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.100
All right, then.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.210
I did spoil your special time
with your girlfriend, after all.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.510
Oh. Mahiru-chan?

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.630
Huh? Y-Yes?

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.130
Mahiru-chan, will you give me
your contact info?

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.460
O-Okay.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.740
That was exhausting.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.160
Sorry. I sent her home
without clearing anything up.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.230
It's all right. There's no real harm.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.520
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.880
It looked like she really liked you, Shiina.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.780
She'll probably keep bugging you.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.790
Shihoko-san really does think the world
of you, doesn't she, Fujimiya-san?

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.540
That must be nice.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.950
What's nice about it?

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.850
Your mother.
She's really bubbly, but she's kind.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.960
More like nosy and annoying!

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.450
It still seems nice, though.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.560
"Mahiru-chan," huh?

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.680
What is it now?

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.960
Oh, it's been a while since someone's
called me by my own name.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.920
It's always my last name.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.080
Well, if you don't have friends who are
that close, then probably just your parents.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.950
My parents would never call me
by my name. Ever.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.630
Anyway, it's just unusual for me.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.440
Mahiru.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.770
It's not hard to get someone
to call you by your name.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.520
I guess that's true.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.650
Amane-kun.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.780
Just don't call me that in public, okay?

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.690
You don't have to tell me!

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.520
You, too. Don't let it slip
in front of people.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.460
I understand. It'll be our secret, right?

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.210
Yeah.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.380
Oh.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.050
I should return your key.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.110
I don't mind if you keep it for a while.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.860
Huh?

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.280
You can just give it back when
we stop hanging out.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.350
Yeah, but...

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.850
It's a pain to have
to go to the door every time.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.230
Your true intentions are showing.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.890
Don't you get tired of using
the intercom and waiting?

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.820
Even if I did, you're making
a very incautious decision.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.490
I'm lending it to you
because I trust you.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.180
All right, then. I'll borrow it.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.460
Just don't blame me if something
happens to your place, okay?

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:55.840
Like what?

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.470
Like you find the entire room
cleaned without your knowledge.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.720
I'd appreciate that!

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.410
Or you find your fridge stuffed
with ready-to-eat meals!

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.590
I'd be so happy at breakfast!

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.750
Are you trying to make fun of me?

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.990
Not one bit.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.980
The Angel Next Door
Spoils Me Rotten

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.490
Seijo High School

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.240
Good morning.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.490
I'm still tired.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.080
They posted the scores today?

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.990

4.     Masahiro Kitazawa 1115 pts.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.980
What's it got to do with you?

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.990
18.          Saizo Minoshima 1028 pts.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.990

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.740
Yeah, that's about right.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.620
First                   Year

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.620
Combined 12-subject test scores for second term finals

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.620
1. Mahiru Shiina 1180 pts.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.620
2. Rika Aizawa 1155 pts.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.620

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.620

7. Mikiya Suzuki 984 pts.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.930
Shiina-san is first place again.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.640
That's our angel! Her brain
must be made of different stuff.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.300
No kidding, no kidding.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.410
You just don't see how hard she works.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.850
Maybe I can do something, at least.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:49.180
Huh?

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.680
Amane-kun, what is this?

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.280
Oh. Cake.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.240
Do you like cake?

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.390
Not especially.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.030
I bought that for you.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.650
Huh? Why?

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.240
You're at the top of the class.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.580
That deserves a little celebration.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.420
Congratulations on first place.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:16.270
But I always get first place,
so I don't think it's that special.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.670
Yeah, but you still always work really hard.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.580
Why not accept a little reward for once?

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.660
A reward...

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.580
Yeah. Congrats.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.920
Thank you. I appreciate it.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.310
Is something wrong?

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.670
No, it's nothing.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.460
Oh.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.300
Wha—

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.560
N-No, I didn't mean I wanted some.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.230
Oh, you didn't?

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.810
I'll take it if you're offering, of course.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.270
You're the one who bought it
in the first place, Amane-kun,

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.980
so I think you have every right to eat some.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.390
It's so sweet!

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.990
Well, it is cake.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.500
Give it here.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.940
I'm, uh...

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.830
Eat.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160
So? How was that?

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.200
D-Delicious.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.190
No. I mean being fed like that.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.950
It was entirely unbearable.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.880
I thought so.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.420
If you do stuff like this,
people get the wrong idea.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.540
I've got to keep my guard up, too.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.840
I thought I'd try making lunches by myself,

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.160
but I'm so used to Mahiru's
fantastic cooking now,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.540
I'm not sure I'll even
be able to finish my own.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.600
Yeah, seriously.
Mahiru is spoiling me rotten.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:46.900
Oh.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.400
Were you shopping, too, Amane-kun?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.740
Well, sorta.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.510
But shouldn't you let me handle that?

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.130
Huh?

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:06.200
Amane-kun, are you confident
you won't make a mess of your kitchen?

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.840
Fujimiya

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.840
Not a bit.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.150
Then it might be best if I
were to supervise things.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.850
So you've decided on the menu?

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.240
Sautéed vegetables and omelettes.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.230
Are you seasoning the vegetables?

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.610
Yeah. Gonna douse 'em with yakiniku sauce.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.890
Quite a bold flavor, then.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.930
Taste it! Please!

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.380
Thank you for the food.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.330
It's just bland scrambled eggs.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.880
You didn't add any salt or pepper, did you?

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.710
Ah... I completely forgot.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.010
And it was supposed to be an omelette, too.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:03.980
You stirred the eggs too much.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.520
What did you think would happen
if you scrambled them like that?

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.900
I even warned you.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.730
I'm sorry!

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.490
Why don't you try the one I made as a sample?

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.300
Please eat it before it gets cold.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.000
Thanks.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.580
I think you did the best
you could, Amane-kun.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.700
The important part is
having a desire to cook.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.480
But if you ever reached the point
where you could cook well by yourself,

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.560
I wonder if my services
would no longer be needed.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.230
No! I mean, I...

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.270
I want to keep eating your cooking, Mahiru!

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.850
Though I know how pathetic
and presumptuous that sounds...

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.780
What am I going to do with you?

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.160
I don't plan to quit any time soon,
so I think you can relax.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:01.910
Thank you.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.550
Maybe I'll have you help out
from time to time.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.300
Peeling vegetables and stuff.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.420
But that's a job for a kid.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.570
We have to start you off small, Amane-kun.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:19.950
Hey, Amane!

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.560
With authentic flavors...

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.680
Xmas Party Set

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.710
Christmas party at your place?

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:22.180
No way.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.640
Aww! Why not? I know you'll be alo—

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.860
Is it your girlfriend?!
The one you bought the presents for?!

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.990
Hell no. I don't have a girlfriend.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.800
Huh?

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.660
But would you really give a stuffed
animal to a casual acquaintance?

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.240
To my neighbor, yeah.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.290
She shares food and helps me out with stuff.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.500
No wonder your complexion
is so much better recently.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:53.370
If there's no girlfriend, then why not?
Let's have a Christmas party at your place!

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.200
If you don't want to, it's fine with us.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.430
Hmm...

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.030
Hmm?

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.320
Hmm...

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.690
Fine, then.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.310
The 24th, right?

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.770
We can wrap up before dinner anyway.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.310
As long as we finish by then.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.940
Ya win. I guess I gotta play along.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.880
Ao ao ao! Tha hurrs!

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.640
Don't be so full of yourself!

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.580
Ikkun, Awane-kun ullying ee!

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.200
Hold it, Amane.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.940
Is this the mouth those words
came out of? Huh? Is it?

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.090
Quit picking on Chi.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.580
I'm the only one who can pinch those cheeks!

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.960
Fine, fine. Then squeeze them
real good for me.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.340
I can handle that.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.590
It's not fair if he makes you do it! Aww!

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.100
Squishy squishy squishy!

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.160
Staaahp!

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.730
You're such a cutie!

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.950
Can I leave now?

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.100
Plans for Christmas?

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.240
Nothing in particular.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.630
Oh, really?

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.740
I was sure you'd have
a girls' night or something.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:56.010
Most of the classmates
I keep in touch with have boyfriends,

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.440
and I turned down
all the boys who invited me out.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.580
I'll be free one way or another.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.740
I bet those boys are all in tears now.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:09.340
But if you're asking me about Christmas
plans, does that mean you have some?

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.110
Hmm?

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.500
Yeah, Itsuki is coming over
on the afternoon of the 24th.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.070
Itsuki?

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.480
He's my buddy.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.070
His girlfriend's coming, too.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:25.470
I understand. Let me know when
your Christmas party is over, then.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.930
Okay. Sorry about this.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.190
It's fine. I hope you have fun.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.000
Won't you be lonely?

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.690
I'm used to it.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:41.950
Being alone.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.300
Ah, actually...

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.710
I realize this may sound presumptuous,

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:58.460
but while Christmas Eve might not work,
how about spending Christmas together?

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.720
Spend it together doing what?

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.260
Huh? Uh...

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.970
I guess there's really nothing to do. Sorry.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:09.770
Then...

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:10.730
Huh?

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.210
I want to try that thing.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.230
That thing?

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.730
I've never played one of those before.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.740
Is that okay? Just playing games and stuff?

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.780
Yes, that sounds good.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.600
Merry Christmas!

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.880
Still, you sure cleaned up around here.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.750
It was pretty gnarly for a while.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.260
Mm-hmm. And it seems
to have a feminine touch.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.510
Why would you say that? More importantly,

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.470
don't snuggle so much
at someone else's place!

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.010
You jealous, man?

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.270
Not particularly.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.020
I wonder if everyone else
is snuggled up like this, too.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.770
Don't forget the guys who are
crying tears of blood tonight.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.490
Oh, yeah. A while ago,

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:06.710
a bunch of boys ganged up together
to try to ask the angel out on Christmas...

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.550
If you please!

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.740
I'm very sorry.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.790
...and she shot them all down at once.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.540
She said, "I can't because I have plans
with someone else," or something.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.050
Huh.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.700
You really don't care about
the angel at all, do you, Amane?

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.550
Is it because your neighbor's
the real angel to you?

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.310
Wanna get kicked out?

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.310
Oh noes!

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.310
Ikkun, look! It's snowing!

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.540
Whoa! We're getting a real white Christmas!

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.570
Hey, hey, Ikkun! Let's go out on the balcony!

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:41.100
Yeah!

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.070
White Christmas!

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.770
First snow of the season.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.480
Huh?! Wha—?! What are you doing here?!

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.330
What? Whaaat?!?

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.580
Ma...

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.580
Uh...

00:21:58.820 --> 00:21:59.550
Oh.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:39.930
Next Time
