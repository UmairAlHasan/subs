00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:36.179
{\an8}I've seen so many good things about you.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.181
{\an8}You are so cute.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.194
I'll cover your mouth
without my hand if you say that again.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:07.585
Why?

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:15.260
Hey.

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:18.012
What program are you participating in
on sports day?

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.348
I haven't decided yet.

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:22.767
But scavenger hunt race
sounds like a lot of fun.

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:25.687
It's going to be so much fun!

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.190
Because I'm going to officiate it.

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:31.401
I'm looking forward to it.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:33.611
Hi, Amane.

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:35.864
Fujimiya, good morning.

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:36.781
Good morning.

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:39.659
Amane, good morning.

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:40.910
Good morning.

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.880
CAFETERIA

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.925
Amane, did you argue with you-know-who?

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.719
Fujimiya, did you have a fight?

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:00.471
No, we didn't.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.308
It's just... well...

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:05.977
Something happened.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:10.940
{\an8}A lot of things have happened.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.859
{\an8}I feel like we are
conscious of each other...

00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:16.821
Man, how long are you
going to be a coward?

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:17.864
Shut up.

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:20.742
You're one of those guys
who are cautious about these things.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.870
He can't approach her
unless he's 100 percent sure.

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.623
That's what a coward does.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.501
If I could be confident that she likes me,

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.795
things would be so much easier.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:37.175
If I were more handsome,
I would feel more confident.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:41.763
{\an8}You are great in every way,
except that you are self-deprecating.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.475
{\an8}It's not very convincing when you say it.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.603
Setting this aside,

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:51.231
I'm determined
to deal with it at my own pace.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.982
Don't rush me.

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:57.153
Of course, you can do that.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.489
You are just making people
around you anxious, that's all.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.490
Exactly.

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:03.618
When are we having a
"Let's kick Amane in the back party"?

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.621
Why would you have a party like that?

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.249
To encourage you.

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:28.643
Um...

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:30.645
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.273
I ran off before dinner.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.694
It's okay, I don't mind.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.540
But... speaking of which,

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.378
why did you do that?

00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:01.259
It was an impulse, to get even with you.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.011
To get even with me?

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.515
You have done the same to me as well.

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:09.183
When did I...

00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:12.437
I guess you are right.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.981
So I have the right to do the same.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:16.816
{\an8}That's not the point here.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:18.818
<i>The point is...</i>

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:21.571
What?

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.574
Nothing.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:28.953
{\an8}I'm in the group red.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.624
{\an8}Right, Itsuki's in group white.

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:36.711
{\an8}Why didn't they divide us
based on our surnames?

00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:38.713
<i>Then you still wouldn't
be in the same group.</i>

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:39.714
<i>We will win together!</i>

00:05:39.797 --> 00:05:40.631
<i>I got it!</i>

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:41.758
-<i>Ah!
-Ah!</i>

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.427
I get it. This is a tragedy.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.263
A taboo relationship where
two enemies fell for each other.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.182
Alright...

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.684
Which programs are
you participating in, Amane?

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:54.812
What do they have?

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:08.159
For which programs did you
sign up for the sports day?

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.247
Relay race and scavenger hunt race.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:14.624
We have one in common.

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:17.210
{\an8}I signed up for ball shooting
and scavenger hunt race.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.837
Here. Enjoy.

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:20.797
Thanks.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.841
So you don't plan to exercise.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.427
I'm not great at sports anyway.

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:30.264
I remember you are
average level in PE class.

00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:32.183
Unfortunately, that's true.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:44.570
You don't like
sports day to be honest, right?

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.865
{\an8}I don't hate sports.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.326
{\an8}But I hate being forced to do sports.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.620
{\an8}I can understand that.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:57.125
{\an8}I don't like being forced
to do things either.

00:06:57.708 --> 00:06:58.543
{\an8}Right?

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.963
{\an8}I'll just try to contribute to the team.

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:06.342
It's a shame I can't see your performance.

00:07:06.884 --> 00:07:07.718
You can count on me.

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.846
I might be excellent at ball shooting...

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:10.847
Maybe...

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.850
You are not sure?

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:17.019
It's not a popular program
and people won't care, after all.

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:19.564
You still have to work hard though.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.066
I'll do it in moderation.

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:23.651
Come on.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.544
This must be expensive.

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:42.628
You can tell?

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:45.214
I can tell from the package.

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:47.592
It's even better than I thought.

00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:48.926
Really? Here.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.019
{\an8}<i>Damn, I fed her without
thinking beforehand.</i>

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.730
Mahiru, you can have it all.

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:06.319
I'll go make coffee.

00:08:06.402 --> 00:08:07.737
You can have the rest.

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:18.581
<i>I wanted to
keep a decent distance from her.</i>

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.625
{\an8}<i>And I failed immediately.</i>

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:23.503
{\an8}THE 41ST SPORTS DAY

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.254
Come on! Group white!

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.006
Don't lose! Group red!

00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:29.800
I'm beat.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.010
Yeah.

00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:32.595
I don't want to move a single muscle.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.224
You don't look scornful.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:37.391
I thought you'd hate this.

00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:40.144
{\an8}I can participate
in the programs I signed up for.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:41.979
{\an8}And I just have free time.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:43.731
{\an8}So I don't hate it that much this time.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.399
By the way,

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:49.111
Chitose was chosen for the relay race
although she's not a track club member.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.238
Does she run that fast?

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:51.197
Yeah.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.490
She is very fast.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.618
She was an ace member
of the track club in middle school.

00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:57.578
Is that so?

00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:58.538
Yeah.

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:01.207
She just didn't join the track club here.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.711
{\an8}She said it'd be a fuss if she got
into a quarrel with some seniors.

00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:09.215
Why does she think that would happen?

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:13.678
There's a reason for that.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.598
{\an8}She's learned her lesson,
or you can say she's tired.

00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:19.100
Tired?

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:23.729
{\an8}She went through something before
starting a relationship with Itsuki.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.565
{\an8}How do I put it...

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:29.402
<i>There was a senior member
in the track club who fancied Itsuki.</i>

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:33.489
And Chitose got better results than her.

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:35.616
I see.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.662
Chi, you are great!

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:40.705
Itsuki!

00:09:43.207 --> 00:09:44.125
I'm back.

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:45.459
Did you see me?

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:46.752
Yeah, we did!

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.045
You were so fast!

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:49.714
Yippee! Thanks!

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.758
I should go now.

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:55.386
Time for the scavenger hunt race, right?

00:09:56.512 --> 00:09:57.430
Amane.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:00.850
I organized the program.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.810
So you'll definitely like it.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:04.895
Good luck.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.441
I only have a bad feeling.

00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:13.529
<i>All competitors, please stand
at the starting line in order.</i>

00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:16.490
<i>Ready...</i>

00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:17.992
<i>Set...</i>

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:30.630
Fujimiya, the person
I want to borrow is you.

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:33.758
Can you come with me
after you get everything you need?

00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:35.926
-Me?
-Yeah.

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:42.183
<i>She'll definitely pay for this.</i>

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:44.435
What item do you have to get?

00:10:44.518 --> 00:10:45.519
It's a secret.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.355
It's you who I have to borrow.

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:48.481
Let's just finish the race.

00:10:49.273 --> 00:10:52.068
What is your item, Fujimiya?

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.527
It's a secret.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:58.240
Okay, we'll see at the finishing point.

00:10:58.866 --> 00:10:59.700
{\an8}Hey.

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:04.914
Is Shiina holding hands with that guy?

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:07.291
It's probably just because
she's borrowing him.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.669
What the heck?!
Switch place with me, Fujimiya!

00:11:12.963 --> 00:11:15.633
<i>The two of them arrived together!</i>

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:19.345
<i>Aren't they competitors?</i>

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.806
We were each other's scavenger item.

00:11:23.265 --> 00:11:25.684
<i>Let's see what tasks you got then.
Who first?</i>

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:28.479
You go first, Fujimiya.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.733
<i>Let's see.</i>

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.610
<i>The task placed on the first
of the group red was...</i>

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:37.613
<i>find "the prettiest person."</i>

00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:40.616
<i>You got it right, there's no doubt.</i>

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.119
<i>Next is Shiina.</i>

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:53.087
<i>What kind of task made
her choose to take me?</i>

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:59.885
<i>Group white, successfully reaching
the goal simultaneously, was tasked...</i>

00:12:01.011 --> 00:12:02.888
<i>to get "An important person."</i>

00:12:19.613 --> 00:12:21.240
You've got some explaining
to do, Fujimiya.

00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:24.493
Why were you together with Shiina?
How could you be her "important person"?

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:25.870
When did it start?

00:12:25.953 --> 00:12:27.788
You two never interacted, right?

00:12:28.372 --> 00:12:31.876
And what did she see in you?

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:33.419
I don't understand this.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.547
I can't answer if you ask
so many questions at the same time.

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:39.258
Why don't you ask me one by one?

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:42.845
When did you get close to her?

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:44.346
Last year.

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:46.474
So...

00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:51.145
{\an8}The guy with Shiina
at the New Year festival and Golden Week...

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.439
{\an8}That was probably me.

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.734
How did you two get close?

00:12:56.817 --> 00:12:59.111
You almost never talked to each other.

00:12:59.695 --> 00:13:01.614
And why did you pretend
that you were strangers?

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.116
We got to know each other
because we are neighbors.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.746
{\an8}And we pretended because
we knew there'd be a fuss.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.166
I don't accept this.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.960
Fujimiya, you...

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:17.421
Are you dating Shiina?

00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:26.555
{\an8}We are close and I can say that we
are very important to one another.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.515
{\an8}But we are not dating.

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:31.185
{\an8}This is just a one-sided thing from me.

00:13:31.268 --> 00:13:36.190
{\an8}But you always looked like you
weren't interested in the Angel.

00:13:36.273 --> 00:13:38.359
{\an8}It's true that I'm not interested
in the Angel.

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:43.697
{\an8}Because I only see a girl
called Mahiru Shiina.

00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:46.784
Please leave him alone.

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:52.414
It'll be a bother if he can't
have lunch at lunchtime.

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.208
Shiina.

00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:55.918
You said Fujimiya is an important person...

00:13:57.211 --> 00:14:00.047
Amane is an important person to me.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.176
So... So you like him?

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:09.181
If that is true,
what are you trying to say here?

00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:11.559
No, I'm just thinking...

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:16.438
Why do you have to fall
for someone like Fujimiya?

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:18.941
{\an8}Someone like Fujimiya?

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.693
{\an8}Mahi... I mean Shiina.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.406
Fujimiya is too average
to be your boyfriend.

00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:27.199
You have better choices.

00:14:27.783 --> 00:14:28.701
{\an8}Is that so?

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:35.207
{\an8}So, what's so average about Amane?

00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:37.668
{\an8}Eh... Well...

00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:38.586
{\an8}He's just...

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:42.464
{\an8}Can you describe to me in detail
what's so average about him?

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:46.218
{\an8}Like his vibe... and looks.

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:49.221
{\an8}Do you pick your partner
based on their looks?

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:50.890
No...

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.267
So you like anyone
who's got a pretty face?

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.437
You might spend a long
life with that person,

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.397
and you only care about their looks?

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.024
I...

00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:01.984
{\an8}Above all,

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:05.195
whoever I like for whatever reason,

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:08.616
no one has the right to judge.

00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:17.708
That was too much. Sorry.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.503
Allow me to correct what you just said.

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:25.591
Amane is very handsome and gentle.

00:15:26.967 --> 00:15:30.387
His quiet and warm personality
is very charming.

00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:34.141
He's very gentlemanlike

00:15:34.224 --> 00:15:36.685
and he respects me,
which I appreciate a lot.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:42.608
{\an8}He cares for me and supports
me when I'm having a hard time.

00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:49.657
And at least, he doesn't speak ill of
people or step into their personal life.

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:52.785
Is there anything else you want to say?

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:56.038
No... there isn't...

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:58.916
I'm really sorry.

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:05.297
Let's have lunch together, Amane.

00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:07.257
Okay.

00:16:08.258 --> 00:16:10.844
-One... two...
-One... two...

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:12.096
-Three...
-Three...

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.056
-Four...
-Four...

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.057
-Five...
-Five...

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.183
-Six...
-Six...

00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:17.559
<i>I need to tell her.</i>

00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:21.855
<i>I have to tell her when I get home.</i>

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:42.251
{\an8}<i>How should I say it?</i>

00:16:58.559 --> 00:16:59.518
Amane.

00:17:10.654 --> 00:17:16.410
I think you must have
a lot to say or ask me.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.955
But can you allow me
to say something first?

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:21.540
Okay.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.501
It's my fault that I cut off your retreat

00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:30.299
and brought unwanted attention to you.

00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:32.801
I'm really sorry.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.432
I... I knew all along that
this would happen one day.

00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:45.481
{\an8}I knew you were in this consciously.

00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:48.358
Aren't you mad?

00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:50.110
I'm not mad.

00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:51.236
Really?

00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:52.946
I'm glad.

00:17:55.532 --> 00:17:57.201
Can I apologize to you?

00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:58.702
Why?

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:01.830
{\an8}Sorry for being such a coward.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.460
I knew everything but I was
too scared to make that crucial move.

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:11.215
{\an8}I pretended that I didn't understand
your feelings. I'm so sorry.

00:18:17.304 --> 00:18:21.475
That's alright.
Because I did exactly the same.

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:26.396
I wouldn't have made this move

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.732
if I hadn't been sure about
your feelings about me.

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:31.235
That's why I said

00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:33.654
I'm a sly person.

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:35.405
Are you?

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:42.162
I'm slyer than you.

00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:48.377
Can I say something now?

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.301
{\an8}This is my first time falling for someone.

00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.429
{\an8}I used to think this would
never happen to me.

00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:02.432
{\an8}I thought I was unable
to like others.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.394
Because of what happened before?

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:06.937
Yeah... exactly.

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:12.276
{\an8}So I thought I could never
actually fall in love with someone.

00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:17.072
But you proved me wrong so easily.

00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:22.452
People change when they
meet someone they love.

00:19:23.036 --> 00:19:26.832
At first, I thought you were charmless.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:31.336
<i>I know. You said it to my face.</i>

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:34.923
{\an8}Sorry about that.

00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:36.717
{\an8}When we just met,

00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:39.678
<i>you were cold and difficult,</i>

00:19:39.761 --> 00:19:40.971
<i>and you weren't nice.</i>

00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:44.308
<i>So I thought we could just
be together for our mutual interests.</i>

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:51.732
{\an8}But somehow, I started to want more.

00:19:54.234 --> 00:19:56.737
{\an8}I started to want to know you better,

00:19:57.404 --> 00:19:59.615
<i>I started to want to touch you,</i>

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:03.493
<i>cherish you from the bottom of my heart...</i>

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:05.746
And I wanted you.

00:20:06.496 --> 00:20:08.248
That was the first time
I ever felt like that.

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:11.001
{\an8}Yes...

00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:15.255
I've been denying my feelings because
I thought I didn't deserve you.

00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:18.634
But you accepted me,

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:20.636
so I didn't want to give up.

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:23.764
I started to wonder what I should do
to make myself better for you.

00:20:24.973 --> 00:20:29.019
{\an8}But you made your move
before I take any action.

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:33.023
{\an8}I've been keeping it down too.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.651
<i>You are so handsome,</i>

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:39.154
<i>I was so worried that someone
would take you from me.</i>

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.867
{\an8}And I was worried if you would like me.

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:46.745
{\an8}Only you have such weird taste.

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:49.456
{\an8}You are saying something like that again.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.340
So from now on, I'll work hard

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:00.842
to change my impression.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:03.845
{\an8}Until people stop saying
you have a weird taste.

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:06.348
{\an8}I will work hard to become a good man

00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:08.433
<i>who can match up to you...</i>

00:21:09.142 --> 00:21:12.604
<i>Or... I should at least make
myself good enough to be confident.</i>

00:21:16.191 --> 00:21:19.236
{\an8}I like you more than anyone else.

00:21:24.324 --> 00:21:26.618
{\an8}Will you be my girlfriend?

00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:28.829
{\an8}Yes.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.170
{\an8}<i>I will never let you go.</i>

00:21:38.046 --> 00:21:39.631
{\an8}I want to make you happy.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.384
{\an8}That's not a promise?

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:47.931
{\an8}That's my wish.
I want to make you happy by myself.

00:21:49.057 --> 00:21:50.058
{\an8}As for promises,

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:53.645
{\an8}I will definitely cherish you.
