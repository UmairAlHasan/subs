00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.920
(Isn't that maybe how love's defined?)

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.650
Wow! A gift for you!

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.520
(So, isn't that true love defined?)

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.710
Nothing happening,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.910
every day feels the same

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.320
Over and over, just

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.400
waiting for time to pass

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.420
When I'm with you,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.620
I can feel

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.750
something so special,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.880
and I want to make it real

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.380
Look, I'm really grateful every day, but you know

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.270
I feel like I'm not doing enough in return

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.920
"I was just feeling like it.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.720
No real meaning or reason why."

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.110
Stop complaining and just take it already!

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.960
(Isn't that maybe how love's defined?)

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.520
Yeah, there's no way that's how it goes!

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.320
(So, isn't that true love defined?)

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.360
Whoa oh oh oh oh

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.810
An angel just landed

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.700
Right in front of me

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.320
With a smile that looked

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.990
Like her wings spreading open

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.950
Hey, that's against all the rules

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.360
You look so happy

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.290
Wipe off that look

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.180
Before my mind goes blank

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.020
If you keep this up,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.640
You're gonna spoil me rotten

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.760
Come on, you gotta do something about this

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.480
So, let's get started

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.610
I want to know

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.640
A lot more about

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.680
The world you live in

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.880
So, let's get started

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.910
I want to laugh

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.890
A lot more with you

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.050
In the world you live in

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.640
The Angel Next Door
Spoils Me Rotten

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.020
I want to know more

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.690
I want to laugh more

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.990
First Shrine Visit (Hatsumode) with the Angel

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.250
And now, the temple bell
to ring in the new year.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.090
Huh?

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.540
Oh.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.760
I wish you a happy New Year.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.560
Happy New Year.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.680
This feels really weird,
spending New Year's together.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.690
I suppose it does.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.600
I hope we can continue
our relationship this year.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.370
Me too.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.920
I mean, I feel like I'm the one
who should be asking.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.570
I can't argue with that.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.480
I'm going to send a few replies.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.120
I should, too.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.340
Today

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.340
Having a cozy New Year's Eve with Shiina-san?

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.640
Itsuki, you jerk.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.340
Shove it.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.340
Read

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.640
Today

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.640
Mom

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.640
Happy New Year! Did you have a fun Eve with Mahiru-chan?

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.820
Geez. Mom, too?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.640
No comment.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.640
Read

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.480
Dad

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.480
Happy New Year. I hope this turns out to be another good year for you.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.860
Dad

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.860
By the way, mind if we visit your place day after tomorrow?

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.370
Dad

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.370
By the way, mind if we visit your place day after tomorrow?

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.370
Read

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.450
The day after tomorrow...

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.350
Hey. If you fall asleep here,
you might catch a cold again.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.020
Mahiru was busy all day today
making food for the new year.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.560
She said she'd recovered from the cold,
but it looks like she still overdid it.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.240
So I get why. I get it, but...

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.670
Mahiru, wake up. Mahiru!

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.020
Man, she smells so good!

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.080
What should I do?!

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.970
The only countermeasures
I can think of are...

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.800
Boo!

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.850
Wha—?!

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.050
Startle her awake.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.520
I don't think she'd take kindly to such a rude
awakening when she's so tired already.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.690
Shiina

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.690
Two:

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.690
Take Mahiru back home.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.760
I can't fumble through
a girl's clothes for a key

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.110
and go into her room without permission!

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.200
Not a chance.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.460
Three:

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.290
Put her in my bed while I sleep on the couch.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.820
I think that's the best I can do.
A good compromise.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.670
Good night.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.400
She's in for a real shock when she wakes up.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.120
Huh?!

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.400
She isn't even up yet!

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.760
She shouldn't drop her guard like this.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.150
Sure looks cute when sleeping, though.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.230
Phew.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.420
Huh?

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.050
M-Morning.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.680
Um, good... morning!

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.600
You fell asleep at my place,
so I let you sleep here.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.310
Nothing happened.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.180
In fact, you should thank me
for doing absolutely nothing.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.940
What is happening here?

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.050
Amane-kun, do you really like
touching cheeks?

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.720
Huh?

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.410
You touched mine on Christmas
and then before I fell asleep last night.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.800
You were awake the whole time?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.210
Huh? N-No, it's just...

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.440
I woke up for a second
when you put me in bed.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.220
What else could I do
but pretend to be asleep?

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.300
And you didn't stop to think
I might try something?

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.310
I didn't think you would, at least...

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.310
I might have been pretending
just to make sure you wouldn't.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.810
Well, I guess it's okay if it helps you trust me,

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.920
but you can't do that again.
I'm still a guy, you know.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.950
Uh... yes, I know that.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.240
Or did you want me to make a move?

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.220
How could you even say that?!

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.530
Well, you are in my bed.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.880
It's been half a year, Amane.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.110
Good to see you, Dad.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.800
You weren't that polite to your mom!

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.740
Yeah, because you surprised me and barged in.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.440
What's the luggage for?

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.970
We brought some things with us.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.290
But first, where's Mahiru-chan?

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.940
Inside.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.110
Mahiru-chan, it's been so long!

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.100
It's good to see you again.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.810
So long? It hasn't even been a month.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.790
Well, it felt like a long time to me.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.000
Amane-kun's brother... no, father?

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.630
Nice to meet you.
I'm Amane's father, Shuto Fujimiya.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.830
Shihoko-san told me
all about you, Shiina-san.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.740
Thank you for looking after my son.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.150
Pleased to meet you. I'm Mahiru Shiina.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.480
Amane-kun has actually
been a great help to me.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.090
Oh, dear. You don't need to be so modest.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.480
We know how much of a slob Amane is.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.130
Yeah, sorry for being a slob.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.600
Come on now, Shihoko-san.
Don't say things like that.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.570
All right.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.460
Amane.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.390
Hmm?

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.880
She always takes care of you,
so I hope you show her some appreciation.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.410
Y-Yeah.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:47.420
Yes, Amane-kun
is surprisingly very considerate.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.280
"Surprisingly"?
What do you mean "surprisingly"?

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.680
You know...

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.880
I'm glad to see you both get along so well.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.320
Amane, you'd better not cause
too much trouble for Shiina-san, okay?

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.010
I know.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:06.020
And Shiina-san, if Amane ever acts badly,
feel free to give him an earful.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.590
This kid is more cooperative than he looks,

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.440
so I'm sure he'd improve any
bad behavior you point out.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.320
Amane-kun is very kind to me.
He doesn't behave badly.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.200
But he might have some flaws...

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.660
Like how he's always
so cool without even trying.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.990
Oh.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.710
Heh?

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.670
What was that for?

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.150
Here you go.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.970
Thank you so much, Mahiru-chan.
You seem like you're used to things here.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.460
Y-Yes, I am.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.400
By the way, Amane.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.070
Hmm?

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.430
You started calling
Mahiru-chan by her first name, right?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:51.210
This is so nice. I'm tickled to see
my son get along with such a pretty girl.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.830
Meanwhile I'm in a cold sweat,
worried you'll slip back into old habits

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.990
and start brutally teasing him.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.030
Oh, my. But wouldn't you stop me, Shuto-san?

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.960
If you're aware that it's wrong,
you should probably try to fix it.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.810
But I guess that quirk is one
reason I fell for you, Shihoko-san.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:07.660
What can I say?

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.290
Oh, Shuto-san, you!

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.590
Your parents get along quite well.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.670
Yeah, they do.
They're always like this at home.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.640
Is that right?

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.810
Hey, kids. You haven't gone
on your first shrine visit yet, have you?

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:25.790
No.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.880
I thought so! That's why I brought a kimono!

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.280
It's always been my dream to take
my daughter on a shrine visit in a kimono,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.340
and I thought Mahiru-chan
would look just gorgeous.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.480
Well, if Mahiru's okay with it,
why not dress her up and take her?

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.500
Oh? And why don't you think you're coming?

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.080
Yeah, if the kids at school caught
me out with Mahiru, it'd be a mess.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.960
So just don't get caught.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.300
Well, I guess it isn't awful.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.220
When you get dressed up
without putting up a fuss,

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.470
I think you look very handsome, Amane.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.200
That's a little too generous
even for a parent.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.520
Itsuki was saying the same thing, though.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.150
Oh, that Itsuki-kun?

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.390
He must be a really good kid
if you vouch for him.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.160
Yeah, he's a good guy.
Probably too good for me.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.910
Are you glad you came here, Amane?

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.360
Yeah, I am. It's a lot easier.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.160
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.500
Thanks for waiting!

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.270
Well?

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.140
Mahiru-chan is a great model,
so it was a very rewarding process!

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.890
Yes, you look very good in it.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.400
Come on, Amane. Tell her what you think.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.650
I th-think it looks good on you.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.530
You're really no good at this, are you?

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:05.180
All right. Shuto-san,
should we get the car ready?

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.280
Yeah, let's do that.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.290
Thank you for waiting.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.300
Is something wrong?

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.960
I just think it looks good on you.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.800
You really nail the
"pure Japanese beauty" look.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.360
Cute and beautiful at the same time.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.090
Ah, I forgot how much you hate compliments.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:28.990
Sorry.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.930
N-No, that... isn't it.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.480
Amane-kun, you kind of look...

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.460
Kind of look...?

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.510
Amane-kun.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.110
Hmm?

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:46.240
Um, I think you look really good, too.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.070
Now that's just unfair.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.960
The Angel Next Door
Spoils Me Rotten

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.470
Happy New Year

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.470
Happy New Year

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.470
Plague Begone

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.470
Exit Route

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.470
Visit Shrine

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.380
Is something the matter?

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.790
It's nothing.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.740
Are you sure?

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.380
Are you okay?

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.370
Yes. It's just the hem.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.660
But it isn't too—

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.780
You sure don't look okay.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.510
I'm sorry.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.250
Come on. Give me your hand.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.530
Exit Route

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.790
You were praying a long time.
What did you ask for?

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.420
Health and safety, I guess.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.040
A super conventional one.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.170
That and...

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.000
That and?

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.990
To keep on enjoying peaceful days like these.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.850
It sure isn't peaceful with my mom around.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.850
Fortunes

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.020
That's fun in its own way, though.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.850
Are you sure about that?

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.730
Hey, you two!

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.730
Should we get going?

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.810
Sure.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.490
Sweet Sake & Red Bean Soup

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.410
Sweet Sake & Red Bean Soup

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.260
How's the red bean soup?

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.410
It's really good.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.380
Can I have a sip?

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.240
Huh?!

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.770
I-I guess so...

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.000
It's fine if you don't want me to.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.820
It's not that.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.210
It's not that I don't want you to, but...

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.420
But?

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.390
N-No. It's fine. Here.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.810
And I'll have some sweet sake.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.260
S-Sure.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.860
It's sweet.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.230
What, don't you like the flavor?

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:26.610
It's not that.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.650
Amane-kun, you were so conscious
of this when we ate cake.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.990
So why aren't you now?

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.600
S-Sorry! I spaced. You hated it, right?

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:52.800
Sweet Sake & Red Bean Soup

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.900
Why do you have to put it that way?

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.150
I didn't hate it, but, well...

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.360
It was just embarrassing.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.660
I'll be more careful. I'm sorry.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.800
I-I'm really not that worried about it!

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.710
I'm still sorry.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.640
I shouldn't act the same way
I do around the other two.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.470
Gimme a sip!

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.650
Chitose!

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.820
We're friends! It's fine, it's fine!

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.240
Do you always do that sort of
thing with Akazawa-san?

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.910
Yeah, we're all friends.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.340
In that case...

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.710
You and I are close friends,
so I'm okay with it.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.590
O-Okay.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.760
I feel bad. You must be exhausted.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.370
No, I'm fine. I had a good time.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:34.220
Good.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.500
Also...

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.470
Also?

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.610
I feel like I got a taste of real happiness.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.100
E-Excuse me?

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.250
It's nothing.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.070
This isn't nothing. You'll mess up my hair.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:57.700
So I can't?

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.360
I'm not saying you can't,

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.700
but at least warn me first.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.960
I'm touching.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.170
Not after the fact!

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.240
Sorry.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.170
Oh, boy. This is all right with me,

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:17.780
but you shouldn't pat most girls
on the head so casually.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.560
Well, I wouldn't do it to anyone else.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:23.980
Huh? Oh.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.980
What? You wanted me to keep going?

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.860
Please stop teasing me!

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.420
Maybe I overdid it.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.730
A-Amane-kun.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:41.240
What is it?

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.700
Amane-kun, you dummy!

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.380
Who's the real dummy, though?

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.800
Are you going back already?

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.420
Yes, we don't have a choice.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.040
I would have loved to stay another
day or two, but we have work.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.510
Well, we'll have another chance.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:07.770
However, I think next time is Amane's turn.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.150
I know, I know. I'll go visit in the summer.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.320
Geez.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.570
They're pressuring me
to bring Mahiru along, too.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.820
As you can see,
our Amane can be a little stubborn,

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:23.200
but if you take a close look,
he's a straightforward and gentle kid.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.490
I'd be thrilled if you'd continue
your friendship with him.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.710
Do you have to say that now?
I'm standing right here.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.840
I'm constantly reminded of what a kind
and sincere person Amane-kun is.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:39.200
As for staying friends, that's
something I'd even ask for myself.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.100
I'm glad to hear that. How reassuring.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.690
Yes, really! Isn't that nice, Amane?

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:46.600
We'll visit again, okay?

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.100
Fujimiya

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.100
You don't need to
flatter me in front of them.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:54.020
Do you think I'd flatter you
with compliments I didn't mean?

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.440
N-Not directly to me, but you
might for my parents' sake.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.780
Please listen to me.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:06.110
I truly think you have a wonderful
personality, Amane-kun.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.960
That's why I trust you enough
to spend time with you like this.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.540
I didn't mean it as mere flattery.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.210
O-Oh.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.750
But it's all right as long as you understand.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.130
So, shall we start getting ready for lunch?

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.720
Trust, huh?

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.880
I'm so glad I moved here.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.230
Hey, hey, did you hear?

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.760
There's a rumor that Shiina-san
in class A has a boyfriend.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.210
I did, I did!

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.650
They say she was holding hands
with some boy on a shrine visit.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.880
Shiina-san didn't seem like
she'd give anyone a shot,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.720
but maybe that was because
she had a boyfriend.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.980
They said he looked really cool and
they'd never seen him at school before.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.020
You think he's from another school, then?

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.130
Hey, Amane.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:53.790
Don't care.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.040
I haven't said anything yet.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.500
Not my problem.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.440
Very well, sir.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.090
H-Hey!

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.580
You try to hide it but you
do have a nice face.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.100
Coming from you,
it only sounds like you're teasing.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.230
You're always like this, man.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:11.980
Shut up.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.980
So our Shiina-san finally
has a boyfriend, huh?

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.260
They're talking about it all over school.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:28.090
It's good that nobody realized it was you,
but it's quite a misunderstanding.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.190
It's going to be difficult to clear up.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.180
Is holding hands enough
to make me your boyfriend?

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:39.750
I wouldn't know. For now, I insisted
that it was just an acquaintance.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.030
We just have to wait for the talk to die down.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.810
Yeah, I guess that's all we can do.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.010
Did we really...

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.930
Hmm?

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.560
look that much like a real couple?

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.370
Who knows?

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:58.380
But personally, I could never imagine
a guy like me as your boyfriend.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.850
What do you mean "like you"?!

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.830
I know you have a low opinion
of yourself, but that isn't right!

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.200
I think you're a really
decent person, Amane-kun.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.300
You're kind, considerate, gentlemanly...

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.530
and, um, I think you have a great personality.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:24.260
When you dress up, you look really good, too.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.900
R-Really?

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.970
Um, thank you.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.240
So I mean, um, well...

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.920
Don't be so hard on yourself!

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.690
O-Okay...

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.480
I'm... gonna wash the dishes!

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.740
S-Sure!

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.430
If you're gonna get that embarrassed,
why say it in the first place?

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:39.930
Next Time
