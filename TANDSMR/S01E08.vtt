WEBVTT

00:01:32.383 --> 00:01:33.927
-Which class are you in?
-Class C.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.430
SECOND GRADE

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.933
We are in the same class again.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:44.687
Amane, that's great!

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:46.773
I don't know if it's great...

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:50.068
but I do feel better being
in the same class with you.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:52.320
What's going on?
Are you in your affectionate phase?

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.281
-You're the one who should be grateful.
-I totally overslept.

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:57.367
-In the same class as Chitose.
-My mother woke me up.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.451
Just be happy.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:01:59.494
{\an8}Hey! School ends early...

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:02.205
{\an8}-You're in a class with your crush!
-We have time for crepe today!

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.540
Mahiru.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.209
{\an8}Alright, if you don't mind me.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.379
{\an8}Let's go. I can't wait!

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.214
{\an8}You are a strawberry kind of girl.

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:20.932
Good morning.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:22.475
Hi, Yuta.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.269
We're in the same class again.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:25.895
Yeah.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.438
Fujimiya, I'm glad to be
in the same class.

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.024
Uh-huh...

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:31.693
Me too...

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.404
Fujimiya, I'm glad to be
in the same class.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.656
Me too!

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.201
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:42.745
You were never...

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.208
Fujimiya.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.627
Sorry...

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:50.587
I was in a daze.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.089
I'm glad too.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:55.842
Amane.

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:57.760
You don't look so good.

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.055
Are you feeling under the weather?

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.933
No, not like that...

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.895
It's nothing really...

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:09.147
Please don't worry.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.276
{\an8}What's wrong?

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.694
{\an8}Nothing.

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:18.239
{\an8}I was thinking your hair
would be nice to stroke.

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:21.200
Can I...?

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:22.827
What's gotten into you?

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:26.080
Go ahead if you want to, I guess...

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.041
{\an8}Really?

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:29.459
Well...

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:30.418
Lie down.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.548
{\an8}Please place your head here
for easier access.

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.050
No...

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:40.011
{\an8}Do you have something against my lap?

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:54.108
{\an8}What would you do
If I did something inappropriate?

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.780
{\an8}Then I'll get up
and put you in your place.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.198
{\an8}I am so sorry.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.201
{\an8}But I don't think you're going to do that.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.287
{\an8}You don't have that guts or energy.

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:10.124
If you are in low spirits,

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.126
just let me stroke your hair all I want.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.381
{\an8}I think it's easier for me to stroke
your hair if you stay put.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.886
{\an8}<i>I think she's caring for me.</i>

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:36.651
{\an8}Anyway...

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:41.614
{\an8}a girl allowed you to lay on her lap,
and you haven't said a word about it.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.825
{\an8}Don't you think
it's inappropriate for you, as a man?

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:48.371
{\an8}Hey, you...

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:49.747
{\an8}Chitose told me,

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:53.042
{\an8}if you let a boy sleep on your lap,

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:56.546
{\an8}it'll satisfy his desire
and regenerate his energy.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.092
{\an8}I think it's great,

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:02.719
{\an8}but don't do that to anyone casually.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.055
{\an8}This is my first time doing so.
How could you say so?

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:10.852
{\an8}Anyway, I just wanted to stroke you.

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:14.605
{\an8}You just have to enjoy it.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:17.900
{\an8}I see.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:18.943
{\an8}Exactly.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:30.079
{\an8}Amane, what do you think
of your class this year?

00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:35.001
{\an8}I didn't think we'd be in the same class.

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:40.173
{\an8}It was fun seeing
the look of surprise on your face.

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:42.633
{\an8}Of course, I was surprised.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:44.594
{\an8}And we have to be careful.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:45.511
{\an8}Careful?

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:49.891
{\an8}I can't just drop by and talk to you
or act like we're close.

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:52.060
{\an8}Because we have to keep our distance.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:56.981
{\an8}What's wrong?

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.441
{\an8}No, nothing.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.944
{\an8}I get it in theory.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.697
{\an8}But my heart said otherwise.

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:06.949
{\an8}What?

00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:10.203
{\an8}I'll just accept the status quo for now.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.122
{\an8}What do you mean by "for now"?

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:14.624
{\an8}Whatever, thank you.

00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:17.376
{\an8}When we're at home,
can we behave as usual?

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:18.711
{\an8}Of course.

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:22.465
{\an8}If we want to behave as usual,
then maybe I shouldn't lay on your lap...

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.634
{\an8}This doesn't count.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.139
{\an8}<i>Looks like I'm going
to be a spoiled loser.</i>

00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:32.308
{\an8}You look sleepy.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:36.020
{\an8}Don't worry. I'll wake you up.

00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:37.939
{\an8}Get some sleep.

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:48.324
How long did I sleep?

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.536
About an hour.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.704
You have a cute sleeping face.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:56.707
Don't stare at me.

00:06:58.042 --> 00:06:59.877
{\an8}You have no right to say that.

00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:03.297
{\an8}I keep letting you see me
with my guard down,

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.424
{\an8}so why don't you let loose too?

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:08.636
{\an8}You're the one who let loose...

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.225
Is this the mouth
that's talking nonsense?

00:07:14.308 --> 00:07:15.309
Sorry.

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:16.644
I'll let you off the hook.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.271
Dear me.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.567
{\an8}You look better now.

00:07:24.735 --> 00:07:27.321
You can lean on me if you feel down,

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:30.241
just like when I leaned on you.

00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:32.201
I will consider it.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.830
I... I got it.

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.415
Excellent.

00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:38.749
You are too pushy.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.085
Girls are more or less pushy.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:45.756
{\an8}No one else will ever see me act this way,
and I won't do this to anyone else.

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:47.842
{\an8}So there's no problem.

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:51.679
{\an8}It's a big problem. Jeez.

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:54.432
You idiot.

00:08:06.777 --> 00:08:08.446
Welcome back, Amane.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:10.990
What is that?

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.034
I went to the amusement arcade.

00:08:13.117 --> 00:08:14.368
These are the prizes.

00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:16.621
So many.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.373
What did you win back?

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:20.333
You'll see it later.

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:21.918
Oh, I'm starving.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:26.255
{\an8}Then please go wash your hands
and change your clothes.

00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:29.008
{\an8}I'll dish out the food.

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:30.718
{\an8}Roger.

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:43.564
Don't you like the rabbit?

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:47.193
{\an8}It's lovely.

00:08:47.818 --> 00:08:48.653
{\an8}That's good to hear.

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:03.918
Please stop smirking at me like that.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.461
I'm not.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.796
{\an8}You are!

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:09.840
{\an8}You're making fun of me
for being childish.

00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:11.926
{\an8}I'm not smiling because of that.

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:14.220
{\an8}I just thought you were cute.

00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:17.139
See, you're smirking.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.980
I always feel like you're playing me.

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:25.064
It's all in your head.

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.442
I'll allow it for today.

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:34.198
I'm always the receiving end
of your kindness.

00:09:35.032 --> 00:09:38.995
Your presents, care, the warm atmosphere
you create and so on.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.123
It's nothing.
I only do those things because I want to.

00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:43.833
You don't need to worry.

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:46.627
I want to give you something in return.

00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:48.462
You are so stubborn.

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:53.301
If you care that much, then I'd be happy
to receive something from you.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:56.637
{\an8}I will give you anything I can give.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:09:58.848
{\an8}<i>Anything...</i>

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:04.895
Then could you make me some pudding

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:07.231
with lots of eggs?

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:09.900
Did you choose a cheap gift on purpose?

00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:11.611
Don't be silly.

00:10:12.194 --> 00:10:14.238
It's valuable because you make it.

00:10:15.823 --> 00:10:16.991
I'll make it tomorrow.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.328
<i>A firm pudding with lots of eggs, right?</i>

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:22.079
<i>I'm going to make a delicious one.</i>

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.087
So delicious...

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.423
{\an8}It's a great honor to receive your praise.

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.636
You really can make anything!

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.389
I can make most dishes
because I was trained, after all.

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.058
As expected!

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.852
Thanks to you, I am very happy.

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.605
Happy?

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.357
Of course.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.693
I can eat such delicious dishes every day.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.612
How can I not be happy?

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:56.989
{\an8}It's my daily joy.

00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:00.451
Is that so?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.996
I'm glad to hear it.

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:06.916
{\an8}I can praise you as much as you want.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.460
{\an8}But maybe my compliments aren't enough.

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:13.756
{\an8}I can give you more detailed opinions
If you want.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:17.176
{\an8}It's fine.
I'm going to die if you do so.

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:18.177
You are being dramatic.

00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:20.012
Not at all!

00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:22.473
Your compliments are enough.

00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:23.391
Really?

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:29.480
But you'll still have to cook every day,
so I want to thank you properly.

00:11:30.272 --> 00:11:31.524
Thank you for everything.

00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:35.277
Mahiru?

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.571
You idiot!

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:48.416
I'll do it. You go sit on the sofa.

00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:49.333
Okay?

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:03.722
Itsuki, Fujimiya.

00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:07.810
You're going to the cafeteria, right?
Let's eat together.

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:09.728
I don't mind.

00:12:10.354 --> 00:12:11.772
Itsuki, so it's settled then?

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:14.650
Why do you assume I won't say no?

00:12:14.733 --> 00:12:16.402
Well, actually I won't say no.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.028
Let's get going then!

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:20.072
All right. But...

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.867
isn't Yuta a bit too clingy to you?

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:28.372
I just think Fujimiya is nice,
so I just want to get along with him.

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:33.043
It's good that more people
recognize the virtues of Amane.

00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:34.211
Come here.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:35.880
Who do you think you are?

00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:39.592
Kadowaki, may I ask you a question?

00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:42.303
Are you sure you want to be my friend?

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:45.931
Nothing good will come out
of being friends with me.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.853
You make friends
without having any ulterior motive, right?

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:52.730
I guess that is true.

00:12:52.813 --> 00:12:54.231
Then it's fine.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.943
Anyway, I'm talking to you
because I want to get to know you better.

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:02.072
How beautiful it is to have good friends.

00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:14.668
Are you sulking?

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.422
Is it that obvious?

00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:21.842
You don't look like you are happy.

00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:24.720
I'm willing to apologize
if I did something wrong...

00:13:25.429 --> 00:13:28.641
{\an8}No. It's not your fault.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:32.561
{\an8}How do I put it... I am too narrow-minded.

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.813
If you were narrow-minded,

00:13:35.397 --> 00:13:38.317
then most people's minds could
only be measured in millimeters.

00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:40.903
I must have done something wrong.

00:13:41.737 --> 00:13:44.615
No. You really haven't done anything.

00:13:45.115 --> 00:13:48.202
But... it is related to you.

00:13:48.285 --> 00:13:49.703
I'm confused.

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:51.372
If I'm the reason, I'm really...

00:13:51.455 --> 00:13:53.415
You can't apologize
if you don't know the reason!

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.044
I'm the one who should apologize.

00:13:57.127 --> 00:13:58.420
Why is that?

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:00.381
{\an8}Because I am narrow-minded.

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:02.132
Fine.

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:04.552
If you are really narrow-minded,

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:06.512
then what are you so annoyed about?

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.516
I just... think it's unfair.

00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:11.600
Unfair?

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:13.018
Kadowaki...

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:14.019
Kadowaki?

00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:18.274
{\an8}He's a boy,
so he gets to talk to you anytime.

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:20.776
{\an8}Unlike him, I have to endure
my desire to talk to you.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.778
{\an8}Endure...

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:27.324
{\an8}Akasawa, Chitose, and Kadowaki
get to be close to you,

00:14:27.908 --> 00:14:30.244
{\an8}but I'm left feeling lonely.

00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:33.247
{\an8}But if you think about it,

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.585
{\an8}it's weird for Angel to suddenly
befriend an somber, sullen guy like me.

00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:40.963
{\an8}Why do you put yourself down like that?

00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:42.965
I'm going to be angry.

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:46.552
{\an8}I heard the three of you talking today.

00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:49.889
{\an8}I think you need to stop looking
down on yourself like that.

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:55.102
{\an8}Because it can be insulting to those of us
who are friends with you.

00:14:56.103 --> 00:14:57.229
{\an8}Sorry.

00:14:57.313 --> 00:15:00.399
{\an8}No need to apologize so seriously.

00:15:00.482 --> 00:15:03.277
{\an8}I just want you to have
a little more confidence.

00:15:03.944 --> 00:15:07.531
{\an8}Why don't I just tell everyone
that you're a great person.

00:15:09.366 --> 00:15:12.620
{\an8}I'd be so embarrassed. Please don't.

00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:15.998
I'll try to do it naturally.

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:19.043
Wait, doesn't that mean
you'll have to hang out with me at school?

00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:22.963
I don't want to be the only one left out.

00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:26.592
If I could, I'd like to be
with you like everyone else.

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:28.761
{\an8}I am okay with it.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.222
{\an8}But if we suddenly get closer,
it'll look suspicious, right?

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:34.099
So can we just take it slow?

00:15:34.683 --> 00:15:36.602
You can't just praise me deliberately.

00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:40.773
Well, I'll just praise you
in private for now.

00:15:42.858 --> 00:15:43.692
Next.

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:46.570
Please decide on the menu in groups.

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.282
I'm glad to be in the same group.

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:52.284
I'm glad too.

00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:54.787
{\an8}Why is she talking to Fujimiya?

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:59.541
Look at Amane with his bitter face.

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:01.794
You are the one who should be
held responsible for this...

00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:04.421
Mahiru, join our group.

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:07.633
Itsuki, Amane, join us.

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.803
I'm sorry to trouble you.

00:16:10.886 --> 00:16:13.430
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:16.308
One must accept one's fate.

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:20.187
You can regret befriending us.

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:24.149
I don't regret
becoming friends with you two.

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:26.777
Oh no. I am touched.

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:30.906
I get goosebumps when you're touched.

00:16:31.865 --> 00:16:33.117
It's better to regret it a bit.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.535
You are so cruel!

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:36.912
But I also like the way you talk so mean.

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:37.830
Gross.

00:16:37.913 --> 00:16:38.956
I realized something anew,

00:16:39.873 --> 00:16:42.668
you guys have such a good relationship.
I envy you so much.

00:16:43.293 --> 00:16:44.128
Yeah.

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.213
Mahiru, do you want to join us?

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:50.467
{\an8}Don't force Shiina to keep up with you.

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:52.636
{\an8}It will cause trouble for her.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.055
No, not at all.

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:56.557
See?

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.225
Chitose, don't get carried away.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.894
Anyway, never mind that.

00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:02.187
Let's decide on the menu.

00:17:02.771 --> 00:17:05.065
You can't cook.
Are you really eligible to direct us?

00:17:05.649 --> 00:17:07.860
You're rude. I know how to make an omelet.

00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:11.697
{\an8}Your omelets are practically
scrambled eggs.

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:18.454
Akasawa, do you know how to cook?

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:19.455
Me?

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.582
Well, my cooking skill
is good enough for survival.

00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:25.252
In fact, Itsuki can do any housework.

00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:26.795
I see.

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:31.467
It just makes me look like a loser.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.968
-Did you just find that out?
-Did you just find that out?

00:17:34.094 --> 00:17:36.096
I can't believe
you said that at the same time.

00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:40.350
I think it's okay
if it isn't causing you trouble now.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.520
N-No. I'll try harder.

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:45.898
I occasionally cook when I'm alone.

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:47.357
That's impressive.

00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:53.864
CULINARY PRACTICE CLASSROOM

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.334
You don't know how to cook, right?

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.836
{\an8}I told you I'm not totally ignorant.

00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:10.672
{\an8}I just can't meet
the standard of you-know-who.

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:15.052
{\an8}I memorized the cooking steps
so I won't cause trouble.

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:17.137
How clever.

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:20.557
Shiina, do we need to cook this longer?

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:22.643
Yes...

00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:25.395
Better boil it down a little more.

00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:27.272
I see!

00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:33.946
How do I put it?

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:36.031
You look like newlyweds...

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:38.742
Chitose, please prepare the miso soup.

00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:39.785
Okay!

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:43.080
What's wrong?

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:45.040
Nothing.

00:18:52.422 --> 00:18:54.842
So we're ready.

00:18:55.509 --> 00:19:00.222
Well, then let's serve the food, and take
the pictures for the report before we eat.

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:01.598
Yes!

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:03.767
I am so hungry.

00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:07.187
Itsuki, that's because
you didn't eat breakfast.

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:09.690
I couldn't help it. I overslept.

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:11.775
Can I have a big bowl?

00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:16.822
No problem.
I'll get the salad from the fridge.

00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:18.991
Please serve the rice first.

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:20.659
Then I'll go with you.

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:23.579
I'll have to get the almond tofu.

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:24.872
Okay.

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.210
What are you doing? It's overcooked.

00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:32.838
Shut up!
It's good when it's overcooked.

00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:34.131
What?

00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:35.966
I'll show you.

00:19:49.062 --> 00:19:50.939
{\an8}Shiina, did you get hurt?

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:54.943
No, it didn't spill on me.

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:57.154
Did it spill on you?

00:19:59.072 --> 00:20:02.075
I'm fine. Sorry.

00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:03.785
Don't apologize. It's okay.

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:05.829
It didn't spill on me or Shiina.

00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:07.456
Look.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.417
It doesn't matter if you want
to fool around in the classroom,

00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:13.128
but don't mess around
in a room with fire and knives.

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:18.467
{\an8}Fortunately, no one was hurt this time.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.470
{\an8}But what if a girl get hurt?

00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:23.639
Can you take responsibility?

00:20:25.432 --> 00:20:26.975
S... Sorry.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.978
Just be careful, anyway.

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:31.480
It's dangerous.

00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:39.571
Why am I being punished too...?

00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:40.572
Sorry...

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:46.036
{\an8}Welcome back.

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:47.996
{\an8}I readied the three-color rice bowl.

00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:49.915
Thank you.

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:51.750
I'm suddenly so tired.

00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:56.004
{\an8}You looked cool,
and it's rare to see you act that bold.

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.923
{\an8}It's not like I wanted to touch her.

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:01.260
{\an8}I had no choice. Otherwise, the soup
would've spilled on Shiina.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.805
{\an8}You had no choice?

00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:08.642
{\an8}I think you've done me a great favor.

00:21:08.725 --> 00:21:10.769
{\an8}Thank you so much for pulling me in.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.196
{\an8}Well...

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.908
{\an8}I'll try to get close
to you at school too.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.787
{\an8}Let me know if you have any problems.

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:31.206
{\an8}No problem so far.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.167
{\an8}I just feel the envy of others.

00:21:35.252 --> 00:21:36.128
{\an8}I see.

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:40.382
{\an8}After all, I know you get lonely easily,

00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:43.927
{\an8}and it's not nice to leave a friend out.

00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:46.930
Friend...

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:48.598
No, nothing.

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:07.159
{\an8}Do you think you can just solve
all the problems by stroking my head?

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:10.162
{\an8}No. I just thought you'd be happy.

00:22:10.245 --> 00:22:12.164
{\an8}Yes, I am...

00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:17.878
{\an8}But you can't do that to anyone
when you want to play it off.

00:22:18.545 --> 00:22:20.005
{\an8}I don't do that to anyone but you.

00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:30.265
{\an8}You idiot!

00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:31.600
{\an8}Why do you call me an idiot?

00:22:33.643 --> 00:22:35.979
{\an8}How hard do I have to try?

00:22:36.563 --> 00:22:39.274
{\an8}I don't know what you're talking about...

00:22:39.983 --> 00:22:42.569
{\an8}But pushing yourself only makes you tired,

00:22:42.652 --> 00:22:43.737
{\an8}so just try to go easy.

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.617
{\an8}If I don't try hard,
I won't get anywhere.

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:03.298
So what do you want me to do?

00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:10.555
{\an8}Please start with the head stroking.

00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:35.789
