WEBVTT

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:34.344
The results are out.

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:40.433
AMANE FUJIMIYA 837 POINTS

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.687
You got sixth place.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.106
Yeah, that's great.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:52.529
{\an8}Why don't you give yourself
a little reward for working so hard?

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:58.535
{\an8}If you get into the top ten,
I'll grant your wish.

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:01.204
Yeah.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.499
{\an8}Shiina, congratulations
on getting first place.

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:05.667
{\an8}MIDTERM EXAM RANKING
GRADE 2

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.670
{\an8}You are the one
who should reward yourself.

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:09.838
{\an8}Yeah.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:13.550
{\an8}But it's not always good
to indulge yourself.

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:19.681
You want to give me a reward?

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.892
Like a gift, or something
you want me to do.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.644
Something I want you to do...

00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:27.397
Well...

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:32.026
I want you to help me slice
the cucumbers with the slicer.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.695
Not something like that.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:36.823
You worked hard as well,
so I want to give you...

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:39.409
Slice them and then rub them with salt.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.368
Okay.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.497
Isn't there something else?

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:49.127
No, I'm very content
with my current life.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.135
{\an8}And I believe that a real wish
should be realized by myself.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.137
A real wish?

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.055
Guess what it is.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:04.475
I don't know.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:05.476
I thought so.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.729
So it's okay.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:09.606
We can just keep it like this.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:12.859
So...

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.863
Please lie down, Amane.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.073
No, this...

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.414
It's okay if you don't want it.

00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:28.333
But you asked for this yourself.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:31.210
I do want you to do it.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:34.881
But I feel hesitant when I'm actually
presented with the opportunity.

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:35.840
Um...

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.926
Then why did you ask for
something like this?

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.638
{\an8}Because of my male instinct... I guess...

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:45.183
Then you can follow your male instinct.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.644
I'm rewarding you
for your hard work after all.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.604
No need to hesitate.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.108
{\an8}I'll spoil you as much as you like.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.416
I'll start cleaning your ears now.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.921
{\an8}Please stay still.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.266
{\an8}Does it hurt?

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.685
{\an8}No, it feels good.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.479
{\an8}That's good.

00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:34.774
They say this is every man's dream.

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:36.734
Has your dream been fulfilled?

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:38.069
I guess.

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:40.780
{\an8}You are a guy after all.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.658
{\an8}What else can I be?

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:47.537
{\an8}Okay, please turn to me now.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.208
<i>Wait, if I turn this way...</i>

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.253
{\an8}Amane, what's wrong?

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:56.879
{\an8}Don't mind me.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:02.260
{\an8}Amane, can I stroke your
hair when we are done?

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:03.970
{\an8}Whatever you want.

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:04.971
{\an8}Okay.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.476
Okay, it's done.

00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:20.153
{\an8}<i>She's spoiling me into a loser.</i>

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.450
{\an8}It's not often I get to see you like this.

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:27.368
{\an8}And whose fault is it?

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:28.911
{\an8}It's my fault.

00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:33.583
I just want to spoil you and touch you.

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:37.503
Your hair feels so nice.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.674
{\an8}Does it? Your hair feels much more silky.

00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:44.635
{\an8}You must take care of it well.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.805
{\an8}Is it okay that I stroke your hair
without asking for permission?

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:50.767
{\an8}I like being touched by you.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.480
{\an8}<i>Saying something like that
will get you carried away.</i>

00:06:13.831 --> 00:06:15.083
<i>How unguarded.</i>

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:19.545
Mahiru, wake up.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.967
{\an8}<i>This feels really familiar.</i>

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:26.761
{\an8}Geez.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:37.021
{\an8}<i>She doesn't even know how I feel.</i>

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.651
{\an8}It'd be so much easier if
I could just confess out loud.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.863
Mahiru, wake up. You should go home.

00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:49.450
{\an8}You need to answer, okay?

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:50.993
{\an8}Okay...

00:06:53.287 --> 00:06:54.372
It smells so nice...

00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:56.165
<i>She really is...</i>

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.379
Mahiru, it's late. You should go home.

00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:02.880
We have school tomorrow.

00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:05.049
You don't want to oversleep.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.425
I'll take you to your door.

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.390
Good night...

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:16.853
{\an8}<i>There's no other way.</i>

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:19.105
{\an8}Mahiru, it seems like
you are really sleepy.

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:21.023
{\an8}I'll take you to your room.

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:22.733
{\an8}Can you give me your key?

00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:26.821
SHIINA

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.282
Sorry about this.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.085
<i>This is her bedroom...</i>

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:00.897
You are home.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.900
{\an8}I'll give you back your key,
so don't worry.

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:06.819
Amane.

00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:13.576
<i>She didn't mean anything by it...</i>

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.331
I'm going home, okay?

00:08:19.373 --> 00:08:20.249
No.

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:28.216
{\an8}Seems like it's willing to
sleep with you for me.

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.176
{\an8}Just go to sleep.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.772
<i>It's scary how much
she lets her guard down.</i>

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:43.689
FUJIMIYA

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.149
G-Good morning.

00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:48.027
Morning, why did you come this early?

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:51.405
Right, you must be here for your key.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:53.908
Sorry that I brought it with me.
I'll give it back now.

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:56.619
No, well, that's right.

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:58.704
But that's not it...

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.374
Here.

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.417
Thank you.

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:07.421
-Can I ask you a question?
-Uh-huh.

00:09:08.172 --> 00:09:11.634
I have a framed photo on my table.

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.219
Framed photo?

00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:18.015
I didn't see it. What's wrong?

00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:20.059
Did I break it by accident?

00:09:20.142 --> 00:09:23.688
No, I'm glad you didn't see it.

00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:24.981
That's all.

00:09:25.606 --> 00:09:27.400
I tried not to look at your room.

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:31.153
I just saw the plushies
I gave you on the shelf,

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:37.159
and the teddy bear by the pillow
which I assume you hold when you sleep.

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.580
Please forget those meaningless things.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:43.124
{\an8}But you said before...

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.752
{\an8}I was holding a plushie when I slept...
Is it because...

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:50.089
{\an8}Because you were half-asleep,
you asked me to sleep next to you.

00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:52.174
{\an8}That's just not possible.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.384
{\an8}Sleep next to me?

00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:56.095
Did I really say that?

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.139
Not so explicitly, but...

00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:02.101
You called my name and tapped your bed.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.689
N-No!

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:10.651
I've never thought about... that!

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:15.823
It's just because I feel
comfortable being with you.

00:10:15.906 --> 00:10:18.492
It doesn't mean I have
that kind of desire...

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:21.495
I just wanted the human warmth
or something like that.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:24.040
Yes... that's it.

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:25.625
What do you mean?

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.877
Please don't ask any more questions.

00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:31.714
You have to be more careful.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:36.469
Even though we are close,
you can't stay over on a whim.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:43.893
You were sleeping quite
soundly on my lap though.

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:46.896
That's a different story!

00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:50.191
But I could do something to you.

00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:51.942
Like what?

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:53.277
Let me think...

00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:56.322
I could play a prank on you
and take your pictures.

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:59.033
I feel like you'd really do it.
Please don't.

00:10:59.116 --> 00:11:00.326
And...

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:02.745
We have different
understandings of "do something."

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:05.039
You really have to be careful.

00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:07.375
I understand. Don't worry.

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:09.377
{\an8}You definitely don't understand.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.545
{\an8}You are being rude. I told you I do.

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:14.382
{\an8}Don't underestimate me.

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.509
You wouldn't have done
that if you really understand.

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.969
You are too naive.

00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:23.474
You'd better think carefully...

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:30.940
{\an8}Who's the one that doesn't understand?

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:33.192
{\an8}SEIJO HIGH SCHOOL

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:36.195
-Come on!
-Kadowaki!

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:39.323
Nice one.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:42.576
Okay, it's our turn.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.371
How do you still have the energy
for sports on a boiling day like this?

00:11:45.454 --> 00:11:46.664
Itsuki!

00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:48.374
Good luck!

00:11:48.457 --> 00:11:50.793
You'll be the winner!

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.379
You have the energy too now, right?

00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:55.589
Shut up.

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.301
FUJIMIYA

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:05.641
Good morning.

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:06.642
Good morning.

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:10.688
I know it's inappropriate
to bother you this early.

00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:14.024
But I want you to make sure
of something before I go out.

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:15.025
Make sure?

00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:19.071
I changed into my summer uniform.
Does it look fine?

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.866
Summer uniform...

00:12:22.366 --> 00:12:23.492
Well... um...

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:24.535
Yes?

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:29.373
Is it a good idea to go with bare legs?

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:34.211
But only a few girls
wear stockings at school.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:37.673
Yeah, but are you sure it's a good idea?

00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:40.092
I don't think it is.

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:43.762
{\an8}Do you mean it's unbearable
to see my bare legs?

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:48.017
No. But I think you shouldn't
show so much skin.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.478
The guys will stare.

00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:53.355
Aren't you going to stare too?

00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:56.275
It's rude to say something like that!

00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:58.861
{\an8}You've seen my bare legs
when I sprained my ankle.

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:01.155
{\an8}That was an emergency.

00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:03.782
<i>I had no ulterior motive at all.</i>

00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:05.910
<i>And I covered your legs with my coat.</i>

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:09.038
So you have an ulterior motive now?

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.248
N... No.

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:13.459
You are stuttering. Very suspicious.

00:13:14.084 --> 00:13:15.461
I'm really not!

00:13:17.004 --> 00:13:18.589
Don't get so worked up.

00:13:19.423 --> 00:13:21.008
Sorry, my joking went too far.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:22.760
Don't worry.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.596
I brought stockings.

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:28.516
Come on.

00:13:29.558 --> 00:13:31.477
You don't mind me seeing your bare legs?

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.731
{\an8}Did you show your legs to me like that

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:37.733
{\an8}because you felt it was okay
for me to see them?

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.402
{\an8}How do I put it...

00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:43.030
{\an8}Actually, being seen by you...

00:13:43.697 --> 00:13:44.740
You don't mind it at all.

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:49.370
It's not that... I don't mind at all...

00:13:49.453 --> 00:13:50.496
{\an8}Then don't do that anymore.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.666
{\an8}Only show them to the one you want to.

00:13:56.669 --> 00:14:00.714
{\an8}W-What if I told you, I came over
because I wanted to show you?

00:14:03.133 --> 00:14:05.344
I wanted to see your reaction.

00:14:06.303 --> 00:14:08.806
Although you just kept saying
it wasn't a good idea.

00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:11.100
Of course, you can't do that!

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:13.143
Because... well...

00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:14.895
Because it's dangerous.

00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:17.231
I wouldn't know where I should look.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.233
Don't I look good in the uniform?

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:25.489
You do. You look very cute.

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:28.617
But please put on
your stockings as soon as possible.

00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:33.330
{\an8}Okay.

00:14:34.164 --> 00:14:37.585
I wanted you to be the first one to
see me in the summer uniform.

00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:39.044
I'm glad that I came here.

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:44.592
Mahiru, you changed into
the summer uniforms.

00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:45.551
Yeah.

00:14:45.634 --> 00:14:47.553
It's getting hot after all.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.056
Right, let's go buy some new clothes
for summer next weekend.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.975
Are you in a bad mood?

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:54.727
I'm not.

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:57.104
Itsuki.

00:14:57.187 --> 00:14:58.397
Let's go home together.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.735
We are going on a "No extra class
today that's great" date.

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:05.154
Let's go.

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:06.989
Where are we going?

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:10.618
Let's go somewhere too.
We don't have club activities today.

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:11.911
Yeah, why not.

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:18.542
Shiina, what are you doing?

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:21.503
These are some papers on Sports Day.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:25.799
The teacher asked me to bind
them up when I have time.

00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:27.718
Sorry, Kadowaki.

00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:29.803
Can I take a rain check?

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:32.848
Yeah, I was thinking
about the same thing.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:37.728
{\an8}That's it.

00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:41.065
I didn't want to take up your time.

00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:45.235
You didn't.
I just voluntarily used my time.

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:48.405
Idiot.

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:53.827
She's not just sucking up to the teachers,
but she even does it to the guys.

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:57.665
She has "someone important," says the
person who fawns over guys nonetheless.

00:15:57.748 --> 00:16:00.834
She's such a people pleaser.

00:16:07.174 --> 00:16:10.386
{\an8}Are you bothered about
what happened at school?

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:12.096
{\an8}Of course.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.015
{\an8}It doesn't bother me though.

00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:17.518
{\an8}I knew people would say such things.

00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:20.020
{\an8}I'd be more surprised if they don't.

00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:21.397
{\an8}Is that so?

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:26.610
{\an8}Yeah, I can't get everyone to like me.

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:29.613
{\an8}It'd be terrifying if someone can do that.

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:35.911
{\an8}Some girls don't see eye to eye with me.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.039
<i>They don't make it obvious,</i>

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:42.710
<i>only because the majority
of people speak highly of me.</i>

00:16:43.293 --> 00:16:47.214
{\an8}It's better to go along with others
and not to cause a scene.

00:16:47.297 --> 00:16:48.507
{\an8}Doesn't it hurt you?

00:16:49.216 --> 00:16:52.052
{\an8}It will upset me
if they say it to my face.

00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:56.181
But those people at school today,

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:57.725
they don't hate me as a person.

00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:01.937
<i>What they hate is
my appearance or status.</i>

00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:08.152
The girls who like Kadowaki are probably
afraid that you'll take him as your own.

00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:13.032
Most of the guys will be head over heels
if you show interest in them.

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:17.119
And it seems like
you are not one of those guys.

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:18.912
Well... I...

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:25.753
Kadowaki is not my type though.

00:17:26.336 --> 00:17:27.880
I mean...

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:32.134
We are in a pretty similar place.

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:35.220
So we won't feel
that way about each other.

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:39.975
You and Kadowaki are
seemingly a bit alike.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.728
But he's not that drastically
different in private as you are.

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:46.982
You say it like I'm two-faced.

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:49.818
Is the contrast really that big?

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.029
Well... How should I put it...

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:56.992
{\an8}The real you is a lot cuter
than the Angel you are trying to be.

00:17:58.368 --> 00:18:01.872
{\an8}<i>At first, I thought you
were cold and strict.</i>

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.001
{\an8}But as I get to know you, I realized
you are honest and you get shy easily.

00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:08.295
There is quite a difference...

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.550
And who's the one that makes me shy?

00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:17.179
I... didn't do it on purpose.

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:20.474
It's your fault exactly because
you didn't do that on purpose.

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:24.019
The same goes for you.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.271
And you even went further.

00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:27.648
What do you mean?

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:31.443
You make physical contact
without noticing it.

00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:32.861
It puts me in an awkward position.

00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:35.989
Th-That's not intentional.

00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:38.826
Well, sometimes... but mostly it's not.

00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:41.620
I know it's not intentional.

00:18:41.703 --> 00:18:46.125
{\an8}But you have to be careful as a girl,
or you'll be misunderstood.

00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:48.585
{\an8}I only do that to you.

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.087
I know that too.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.255
That's why I'm warning you.

00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:55.801
See? You are doing it again.

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:58.220
It is intentional this time.

00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:04.184
{\an8}Although it might be contrary
to what I said before,

00:19:05.018 --> 00:19:10.315
{\an8}I always behaved like
an angel that everybody loves,

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:14.987
{\an8}but recently I started
to feel like it's time to quit.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.113
{\an8}Quit?

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:19.700
{\an8}It's okay not to be a good kid.

00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:24.204
{\an8}If someone saw the real me
and is willing to accept me,

00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:27.124
{\an8}then I can just be my real self.

00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:33.964
You will always watch over me, right?

00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:38.594
Can I ask you for a favor?

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.096
You are the only one who can do this.

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.434
Please watch over me.

00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:50.063
We've agreed after all.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:52.858
Yeah, that's our promise.

00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:57.112
{\an8}So I thought I don't need
to pretend anymore.

00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:01.366
{\an8}I won't make any drastic changes
at school for now,

00:20:02.075 --> 00:20:04.620
{\an8}but I won't be so strict
on myself anymore.

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:06.872
I see.

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:09.875
Are you upset?

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:12.294
No.

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:16.757
I'm just happy you changed your thoughts.
I think that's a good thing too.

00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:20.844
But I'm thinking about something myself.

00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:24.681
{\an8}What is it? Tell me.

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:25.641
{\an8}But...

00:20:26.433 --> 00:20:28.560
{\an8}I won't get mad.

00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:33.232
{\an8}I don't think you'll say anything hurtful.

00:20:34.816 --> 00:20:36.818
Well...

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:38.403
Don't laugh.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:41.031
You said you won't pretend anymore.

00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:46.745
I just feel a bit complicated
knowing that other people

00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:50.332
might get to see the real you.

00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:55.963
I know I'll sound arrogant
or ridiculous to you.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.220
Amane, you are so cute.

00:21:03.303 --> 00:21:07.432
Come on, what's cute about a guy like me?

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.226
Everything.

00:21:09.309 --> 00:21:11.228
{\an8}Not handsome though?

00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:13.230
{\an8}Very handsome.

00:21:13.313 --> 00:21:17.359
You are very cute and handsome.

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.027
More handsome than anyone.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:22.489
That's enough. I get it...

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:25.993
That's exactly what makes you so cute.

00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:28.370
I'll hush you if you say
something like that again.

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:29.371
With what?

00:21:29.454 --> 00:21:31.748
What else? My hand, of course.

00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:34.668
Then it doesn't scare me at all.

00:21:35.752 --> 00:21:38.922
{\an8}Even if you don't think so,

00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:42.301
{\an8}for me, you are really handsome.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:47.014
{\an8}I've seen so many good things about you.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.558
You are so cute.

00:23:30.992 --> 00:23:35.914
