1
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,310
What are you doing out here?

2
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,960
Fujimiya-san.

3
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,350
Can I help you with something?

4
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,840
That was the first time.

5
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,110
That was the first time
I talked to Mahiru Shiina.

6
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,980
Meet the Angel

7
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,580
No, I don't need anything.

8
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,580
It's just, if you sit out here in the rain
like this, people are gonna worry.

9
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,820
Is that right?
Well, I appreciate your concern,

10
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,120
but I'm here by choice,
so please don't trouble yourself over me.

11
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,050
You'll catch a cold. Go home with this.

12
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,410
I don't need it back.

13
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,010
Thank you. Very... much.

14
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,430
Seijo High School

15
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,450
Amane, keep it down.

16
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,200
Weren't you fine yesterday, man?

17
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,580
I got caught in the rain.

18
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,970
That's not so bad.

19
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,780
But wait, didn't you have an umbrella?

20
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,750
I gave it to someone.

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,010
You lent your umbrella
to someone when it was pouring?

22
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,590
When did you become such a softie?

23
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,390
Who'd you lend it to?

24
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,470
A lost girl I passed on the way.

25
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,970
Well, aren't you nice.

26
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,970
That's right.

27
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,180
She looked like she was lost.

28
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,770
Good morning, Shiina-san!

29
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,370
Good morning.

30
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,360
Hey, hey, Shiina-san, listen to this.

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,200
Sure. What is it?

32
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,310
The angel. She's super angelic today.

33
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,120
Yeah.

34
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,270
An angel.

35
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,970
That's what everyone at school
calls Mahiru Shiina.

36
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,750
She's attractive and graceful,

37
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,850
gets excellent grades,

38
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,510
First                Year

39
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,510
Combined 12-subject test scores for first term finals

40
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,510
1. Mahiru Shiina 1181 pts.

41
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,510
2. Rika Aizawa 1142 pts.

42
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,510
3. Masahiro Kitazawa 1113 pts.

43
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,510
4. Akane Nishikawa 1090 pts.

44
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,510
5. Hiroki Yusa 1025 pts.

45
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,510
6. Kanako Hasegawa 1005 pts.

46
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,510
7. Mikiya Suzuki 984 pts.

47
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,510
8. Satoshi Ichijo 900 pts.

48
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,510
9. Ryoichi Hara 871 pts.

49
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,830
and her test scores are top of the class.

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,410
And she's even good at sports.

51
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,510
But she's still humble and modest.

52
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,520
She's that kind of angel,
so of course she's popular.

53
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,250
I'm sure most of the guys
in class want to date her.

54
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,530
But that's a world I'm not part of.

55
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,780
Don't you wish you had
a girlfriend to take care of you?

56
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,240
Shut up.

57
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,750
Chitose Shirakawa

58
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,750
Wanna come over tonight?

59
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,250
Quit bragging about having one.

60
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,250
This isn't good at all.

61
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,730
You didn't need to bring it back.

62
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,730
Of course I'm going to
return what I borrowed.

63
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,190
Um, you look like you have a fever.

64
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,870
That's none of your business.

65
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,080
But you lent me your umbrella...

66
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,770
You didn't ask me to. It doesn't matter.

67
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,090
Yes, it does!

68
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,090
You caught a cold
because I was sitting there.

69
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,820
Forget about it already.

70
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,280
You don't need to worry about me.

71
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,760
Fujimiya

72
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,760
B-But I...

73
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,550
Just drop it. See yo—

74
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,850
I can't leave you alone like this.

75
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,520
I'm going to repay the favor.

76
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,010
I'm coming in.

77
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,860
I hope you'll excuse me,
but there's no other way.

78
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,290
I can't bear to look at this.

79
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,660
I'm going to step out for a moment,
so why don't you get changed before I return.

80
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,180
Will you do that?

81
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,590
You're seriously coming back?

82
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,260
If I leave you alone to doze off like this,
you won't sleep well.

83
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,350
Shiina

84
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,350
I'd rather bite off my tongue
than tell anyone at school this,

85
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,600
but I started living alone in high school,
and in the same apartment complex,

86
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,110
Shiina

87
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,110
literally next door, lives the angel herself.

88
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,470
What time is it?

89
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,960
It's 7 p.m.

90
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,840
You slept for about two hours.

91
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,070
I brought it from home.

92
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,840
Thanks for that.

93
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,100
It's okay.

94
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,370
Do you have an appetite?

95
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,290
Hmm...

96
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,610
Yeah, a little bit.

97
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,400
You do?

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,740
I've made some rice porridge,
so you should have some.

99
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,120
Huh? Your home cooking, Shiina?

100
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,260
If you don't want it, I'll eat it myself.

101
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,370
Uh, no, I mean, I'll eat it! Please let me!

102
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,900
I'll bring it over,
so please take your temperature.

103
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,970
Would you please at least wait
until I leave the room?!

104
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,620
Yeah.

105
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,700
I never knew why the other guys
kept saying she's so cute,

106
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,520
but I think I'm starting to get it.

107
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,440
What was your temperature?

108
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,380
38.3 degrees.

109
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,980
I'll be fine with medicine and some sleep.

110
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,160
Over-the-counter medicine
only treats the symptoms.

111
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,210
You need to get some proper rest

112
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,220
and let your immune system do its job, okay?

113
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,820
Here you go. It shouldn't be too hot.

114
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,710
Thank you.

115
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,890
What is it now?

116
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,540
Do you expect me to feed you?

117
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,230
Huh?

118
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,420
I regret to inform you
that is not a service I provide.

119
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,170
Nobody even asked for that.

120
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,440
But...

121
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,150
I'm just impressed that you can cook.

122
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,300
I live alone, so of course I can.

123
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,880
But for you, Fujimiya-san,
before learning to cook,

124
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,290
you really should try cleaning your room.

125
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,100
You are quite right.

126
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,330
It's good!

127
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,980
Well, you're welcome.

128
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,720
But rice porridge is basically
the same no matter who makes it.

129
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,770
Fujimiya-san?

130
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,230
Uh...

131
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,340
Yeah, never mind.

132
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,070
Low Calorie

133
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,070
Easy to Drink Sports Drink

134
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,540
Hey, can I ask you something?

135
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,400
What is it?

136
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,710
Why were you sitting
on that swing in the rain?

137
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,740
Fight with your boyfriend or something?

138
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,660
Huh?

139
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,380
I hate to disappoint you,
but I have no boyfriend

140
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,830
and no plans to get one either.

141
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,510
Huh? Why?

142
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,180
I should be asking you.

143
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,900
Why are you assuming
that I'm in a relationship?

144
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,290
You're so popular,
I was sure you'd have a boyfriend or two.

145
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,320
Well, I don't.

146
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,880
I also don't recall
ever having such loose morals

147
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,680
that I'd go out with multiple boys at once.

148
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,430
That would absolutely never happen.

149
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,380
Sorry.

150
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,050
I didn't mean it that way.

151
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,340
I apologize.

152
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,990
No, I'm sorry I got that upset about it.

153
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,490
Anyway, I was just trying
to cool my head then.

154
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,130
But I am truly sorry
that it resulted in you catching a cold.

155
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,620
Nah, it's fine.

156
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,370
I didn't even ask you first.

157
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,210
You really shouldn't feel guilty about it.

158
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,120
I mean, we're done after this anyway, Shiina.

159
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,630
Huh?

160
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,880
Huh?

161
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,330
Don't tell me you thought I was
guilt-tripping you to try to get lucky.

162
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,340
O-Oh.

163
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,750
I bet that's annoying even for you.

164
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,230
If guys you don't even like
keep coming on to you.

165
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,520
Well, it is, to be honest.

166
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,150
I knew it.

167
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,340
I don't really care, though.

168
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,180
Actually, it's kind of a relief.

169
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,270
Angels get annoyed by that
just like anyone else.

170
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,330
Please stop calling me that!

171
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,250
Well, like I said, I won't be trying
to hang around you for no reason.

172
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,930
Starting tomorrow,
we're basically strangers again.

173
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,080
Good morning!

174
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,900
I don't want to go to math.

175
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,070
Oh, Amane!

176
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,060
Are you feeling better?

177
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,450
Yeah, thanks a lot.

178
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,730
Yeah, I mean, you looked like a mess.
I was getting worried.

179
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,710
I'm glad you're better, though.
Just try to get your life together, okay?

180
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,780
Cleaning house, for starters.

181
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,840
You sound just like someone I know.

182
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,680
Huh?

183
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,930
Never mind.

184
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,030
Hey!

185
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,020
Shiina-san, can you please explain this part?

186
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,810
Of course. To solve this one,
just go like this.

187
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,490
Wow, I had no idea it was that easy!

188
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,030
Ah, Shiina-san, I see?

189
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,970
Thank you, Shiina-san!

190
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,980
Popular as usual, I guess.

191
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,400
You're very welcome.

192
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,850
She is an angel, after all.

193
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,790
A perfectly neutral observation.

194
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,420
For us, she's completely out of reach,
like a far-away dream.

195
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:36,350
I've got no reason to talk to her.
Seeing her around is enough.

196
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,100
What are you eating there?

197
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,020
A jelly drink that replenishes
energy in a few seconds.

198
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,770
That can't possibly be your dinner, is it?

199
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,900
What else would it be?

200
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,980
You've got the appetite of a high school boy
and that's all you're eating?

201
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,060
Please wait right there.

202
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:00,990
Huh?

203
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,490
What?

204
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,990
It's cold.

205
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,900
Wait? For how long?

206
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,460
Huh?

207
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,170
It's only leftovers, but here.

208
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,970
The Angel Next Door
Spoils Me Rotten

209
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,610
Tea

210
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,430
It's so good!

211
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,810
This is amazing, Angel!

212
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,070
I may be doing this for
my own personal satisfaction,

213
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,500
but I saw you living
such a pathetic lifestyle,

214
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,200
and I couldn't ignore it.

215
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,660
Quite so.

216
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,920
I'll happily accept it.

217
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,250
It isn't every day that I get
to eat an angel's home cooking.

218
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,240
Would you please stop calling me that?

219
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,550
Seriously.

220
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,070
Yeah, sorry.

221
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,560
I won't say it anymore.

222
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,650
You're going to start eating well
and living properly.

223
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,780
Sure, mom.

224
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,950
So good...

225
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Shiina

226
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,080
Just returning this.

227
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,690
It was really good.

228
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,820
Thanks for going out of your way.

229
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,800
You even washed it for me.

230
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,550
Well done. So...

231
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,290
Here you go.

232
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,590
Huh? Yeah, no...

233
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,220
I just came to return the container.

234
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,260
It's tonight's dinner.

235
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,220
Yeah, I can see that, but...

236
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,880
I do need to ask,
do you have any food allergies?

237
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,730
I don't accept simple substitutions, though.

238
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,540
I don't, but...

239
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,540
I mean, I can't accept another...

240
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,810
I make too much to eat by myself.

241
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,790
I'd appreciate it if you would accept this.

242
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,830
If that's it, then I'm happy to help.

243
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,660
But normally, if you do this for someone,
they might think you have feelings for them.

244
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,710
You think I do?

245
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,460
No, not a chance.

246
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,980
Then it shouldn't be a problem.

247
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,690
In that case, please excuse me.

248
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,690
After that, the next day,
and the day after that,

249
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,530
Shiina kept handing me
containers full of food.

250
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,250
Life was starting to get weird.

251
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,380
So good...

252
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,070
Hey, Itsuki.

253
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,780
Do I really look that unhealthy?

254
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,290
Oh, yes! Pasty white and thin as a rail,

255
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,600
you always look like you're not into it.

256
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,140
Your expression just screams "unhealthy."

257
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,920
I was born with this face.

258
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,290
Oh, I know.

259
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,820
But why don't you try
to look a little more alive?

260
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,630
So that's it.

261
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,030
I've got a dead look on my face.

262
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,750
Yeah, but there is a little more color
in your cheeks recently.

263
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,890
Did you change your diet or something?

264
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,440
Itsuki...

265
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,290
You're scaring me right now.

266
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,610
Why, dude?

267
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,440
Wait, did I nail it?

268
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,990
No, well...

269
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,830
I was kind of forced
to mix things up, I guess.

270
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,030
10 servings

271
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,030
Delicious Rice

272
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,740
Oh...

273
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,700
Oh?

274
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,000
Just so you know, this wasn't intentional.

275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,790
It's not like I'm following you.

276
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,290
Of course I know that.

277
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,070
This is obviously the closest
supermarket for both of us.

278
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,760
Customer Appreciation Sale

279
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,760
Limited to one per customer

280
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,760
Deal!

281
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,300
Limited to one per customer?

282
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,470
So I'm buying one too?

283
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,340
I'm glad you're such an understanding person.

284
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,850
10 servings

285
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,850
Delicious Rice

286
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,770
Tsuneno Milk

287
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,770
Rich Flavor

288
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,400
I didn't know you were
such a careful shopper.

289
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,360
There's no better way to keep costs down.

290
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,200
Well, if you're living on an allowance
from your parents, that's probably smart.

291
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,080
I guess so.

292
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,390
They do support me,
so it's important that I watch my budget.

293
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,540
Tsuneno Milk

294
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,540
Rich Flavor

295
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,540
100% Milk

296
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,010
I'm not trying to steal it.

297
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,700
I didn't think you were.

298
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,430
But I can carry that much.

299
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,140
In a situation like this, you'd seem a lot
more charming if you just accept the help.

300
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,940
You make it sound like
I have no charm at all.

301
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,820
I'll go ahead.

302
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,230
I know you don't want anyone
seeing us together.

303
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,310
Thank you very much.

304
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,790
Fujimiya

305
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,890
Huh?!

306
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,710
Excuse me, but yesterday's container...

307
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,130
What in the world are you doing?

308
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,720
I was trying to clean.

309
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,540
I just heard a really loud noise.

310
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,930
I almost tripped.

311
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,050
I'm not surprised.

312
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,620
It doesn't look like
you've even started cleaning.

313
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,790
Honestly, I don't know where to begin.

314
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,770
Your room—

315
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,940
please let me clean it.

316
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,240
Huh?

317
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,660
I can't stand the thought
of my neighbor living in filth.

318
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,400
Living alone and yet you do no chores...

319
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,910
Do you think this is some kind of a joke?

320
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:48,290
You know, if you had just cleaned regularly,
it never would have come to this.

321
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,370
'Tis as you say.

322
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,600
Just to warn you,
I'm going to do a very thorough job.

323
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,020
I understand.

324
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,180
As long as you do, shall we get started?

325
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,270
I'm not as soft as you might think.

326
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,450
We're not making any compromises.

327
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,710
Tie all the old magazines together.

328
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Break down the cardboard and pile it up.

329
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,570
Tsuneno Milk

330
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,570
Water

331
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,150
Separate the lids from the plastic bottles.

332
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,050
Cleaning starts from the top.

333
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,430
Put all of your dirty laundry
in the basket for now.

334
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,250
Next, the top of the air conditioner.

335
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,140
Oh!

336
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,630
Fujimiya-san.

337
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,510
The reason you clean is to
keep things like this from happening.

338
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,520
Please accept my deepest apologies.

339
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,490
Should we keep going?

340
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,860
I guess so.

341
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,950
That surprised me!

342
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,950
All cleaned up.

343
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,170
It took a whole day to get this much done.

344
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,800
Yeah, the place was trashed.

345
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,900
You're the one who trashed it, you know.

346
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,280
'Tis as you say.

347
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,420
Oh boy...

348
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,090
I don't feel like going shopping now.
Want to order a pizza for dinner?

349
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,340
Huh?

350
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,400
So this is a delivery pizza.

351
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,730
You've never ordered delivery before?

352
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,700
Are your parents really strict about food?

353
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,400
At home, we had a housekeeper cook for us.

354
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,280
A housekeeper?

355
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,780
You must be pretty rich then.

356
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,280
I suppose you could say
we're somewhat well-off.

357
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,690
Well, I don't know if this is up to
your standards, but help yourself.

358
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,810
Thank you for the food.

359
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,140
What is it?

360
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,090
Nothing.

361
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,170
You're just making it look delicious.

362
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,230
Please don't stare at me so much.

363
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,480
How do I put this...
you really have zero charm.

364
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,230
That is fine with me.

365
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,480
Yeah, I guess that's okay.

366
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,860
I think I'm more used to
you here than at school.

367
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,450
I like this you more though,
because she's easier to get along with.

368
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,610
The one without charm, you mean?

369
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,340
You don't let things go, do you?

370
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,100
What I mean is,
even if you seem a little unfriendly,

371
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,000
you're a lot more approachable
when you're honest about your feelings.

372
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,510
Is my behavior at school really that awful?

373
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,890
Well, no.

374
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,300
But don't you get worn out
always acting like that?

375
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,300
Not really.

376
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,990
I've been like this since I was little.

377
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,270
That's pretty hard-core.

378
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,020
Well, at least you have a place
where you can catch your breath a little.

379
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:01,140
I can't catch my breath with your
staring always putting me on edge.

380
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,580
So sorry about that.

381
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,410
Fujimiya

382
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,410
Thank you for dinner.

383
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,140
Can I ask you one thing?

384
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,910
What is it?

385
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,910
What do you get out of sharing
your dinner with me every day?

386
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,510
My own satisfaction.

387
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,420
It's really not a big deal.

388
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,800
Simply put, I think I just like
preparing meals for people.

389
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:30,560
And you don't take that the wrong way,
you just tell me it's good, so it's easy.

390
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,380
I'm not comfortable with the way you eat
anyway, so I guess it's my own satisfaction.

391
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,810
Is that what this is?

392
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,600
That's what it is.

393
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,440
So just think of it as an unexpected
splash of good luck for you.

394
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,860
Well, well.

395
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,860
All right then, please excuse me.

396
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,330
I guess that's really all this is.

397
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:03,820
This is how the angel and I began
our unusual next-door relationship.

398
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,980
Next Time
