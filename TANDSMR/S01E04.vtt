00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.640
The Angel Next Door
Spoils Me Rotten

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.240
Um, I'm really sorry.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.110
It isn't like this is your fault.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.830
So?! Amane's neighbor was the angel all along?

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.080
Um, I'd appreciate it
if you stopped calling me "angel."

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.080
So what's happened so far

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.600
is that Shiina-san was living next door
to Amane and sharing meals with him.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.410
Is that an accurate description?

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.680
Yeah.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.420
I owed him a favor,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.010
and Fujimiya-san appeared to be
living such an unhealthy lifestyle.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.690
I was worried about him.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.940
I see. Hmm.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.910
I understand the general situation now,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.030
but while Shiina-san makes sense,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.700
it's strange that Amane
doesn't have feelings for her.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.620
I mean, she's like your
very own wife-in-training!

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.210
That is not my intent and is not possible.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.480
I don't have any ulterior motives at all.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.590
That's why Shiina is helping me out
in the first place.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.400
Well, if you say so, Amane.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.780
But seriously, what an odd couple.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.380
Was the stuffed animal for Shiina-san, too?

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.470
Yeah.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.560
Heh?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.350
Shut up.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.340
I haven't said anything yet!

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.480
Your face said plenty.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.780
That's mean!

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.950
The Angel in the Christmas

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.440
So, yeah.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.910
We don't have the same kind of
lovey-dovey relationship you do,

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.950
but if you spill this to other people,
it would be a huge pain for us.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.410
You get that, right?

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.340
Yeah, I get it. I won't tell anyone else.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.480
You, too, Chitose.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.240
I'm not that much of a blabbermouth!

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.920
Besides,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.180
nobody would believe a girl this cute
was making dinners for you, Amane.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.410
Excuse me for punching above my weight.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.540
Hey, I didn't say that.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.180
Don't be so touchy.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.970
I've never seen her
from this close up before.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.360
She sure is pretty enough
to be called an angel!

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.500
Her facial proportions are perfect,
her skin is light and clean,

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.510
her eyelashes are long, her hair is silky,

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.590
she's slim but not flat.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.790
Huh? U-Um...

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.780
And her skin is so radiant.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.250
What do you do to maintain it?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.780
That's as far as you go.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.800
Aww!

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.760
She's really shy. Don't get so physical
when she doesn't even know you.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.450
Oh.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.400
I'm really sorry.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.410
I got so excited,
I almost tried to touch you.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.070
It's... okay.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.360
Shiina, Chitose is a colossal weirdo,
but she isn't a creep... I hope.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.120
Hey, hey, was that a compliment?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.370
I doubt it! Did you just insult me?!

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.940
Can you deny it with an outburst like that?

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.160
No, I cannot.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.960
In that case...

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.920
Huh?

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.920
Can we start out as friends?

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.300
Eh, uh, oh... sure.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.010
Pleased to meet you.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.670
If we're gonna be friends,
I guess we gotta introduce ourselves.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.560
I'm Chitose Shirakawa.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.190
Amane's best friend... right?...
Ikkun's girlfriend.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.110
Aww, "best friend"? Don't make me blush!

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.570
It's gross when you fake
being embarrassed like that.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.180
But dontcha know?
I'm what people call a tsundere.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.460
I'll seriously kick you out.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.660
Throw me out into the icy cold?!
How heartless of you!

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.300
Barf.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.620
Yeah, well, we're always like this.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.180
Starting over, I'm Itsuki Akazawa.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.300
I get to be this grumpy dude's best friend.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.180
If Amane pulls anything really stupid
or weird, you can talk to me anytime. Okay?

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.060
Would you cool it?

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.640
I don't think Fujimiya-san
is interested in me like that,

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.480
and while his homemaking skills
are non-existent,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.500
he is a reasonable person, so I'll be okay.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.160
You didn't need to pick on my
homemaking skills, but thanks for the rest.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.080
Hey, hey. I bet your cooking
is delicious, Shiina-san.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.480
Do you have any specialties?

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.490
Um, I don't really have a specialty,
but I can cook pretty much anything.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.500
That's great!

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.000
I like cooking, too, you know,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.340
but my takes on the recipes
don't always get good reviews.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.650
But even then, Ikkun always
eats my cooking with a smile.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.130
I'm really sorry about that.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.100
It's all right.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.690
I don't know a lot of people like that,
so it was kind of fun.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.260
Yeah, Chitose's kind of an unusual one.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.150
If she gets too intense,
feel free to slap her.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.530
I-I won't use violence,
but I'll try to convince her to stop.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.620
It's really a white Christmas.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.490
It sure is. That doesn't really
mean anything for us, though.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.830
Why don't we just enjoy how pretty it looks?

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.440
But if it keeps falling,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.780
it'll shut down public transportation, too,
so I hope it doesn't snow too much.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.610
Back to being practical again?

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.820
Well, I'll bring over
the beef stew I made, okay?

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.320
For lunch tomorrow, we can
have beef stew over omurice.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.040
That sounds so delicious!

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.240
I'll go get it.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.820
I wish we could have kept it
our secret for just a little longer.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.850
Wait, what am I even thinking?

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.720
Ah, that was delicious!

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.290
I'm glad you liked it.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.790
Amane-kun, you always
look so happy when you're eating.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:11.610
I really am happy. It's because
your cooking is so good, Mahiru.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.930
I'm very glad to hear that.
I guess happiness comes cheap.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:21.640
No, this is a treasure.
You underestimate how valuable you are.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.030
How did you learn
to make so many different things?

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.770
Someone who took care of me taught me how.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:38.520
She said, "When you find someone who makes
you happy, grab him by the stomach."

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.830
Sorry about that. I made you
grab mine instead.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.580
I'll consider it a practice run.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:51.590
But yeah, that person who took care
of you must be an amazing cook.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.840
She sure is. I'm still
nowhere near her level.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.850
Her cooking tastes like pure joy.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.970
It must've been incredibly good, then.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.440
Anyway, for me, your cooking
already tastes like joy.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.090
Oh?

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:14.920
Mahiru?

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.570
Huh? Oh. It's nothing.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.660
Is something wrong?

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:27.290
It's just, I didn't realize I could
make food taste joyful yet.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.790
I don't know why you need
to be so hard on yourself,

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.300
but it's so good I want to eat it every day.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.180
Th-Thank you for saying that.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.100
Uh, for tomorrow, is around noon good?

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.060
Yes, that is what we agreed on.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:55.240
We'll make lunch, and then play
those games we talked about, right?

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.720
I'm looking forward to it.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.450
C-Cool.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.960
The Angel Next Door
Spoils Me Rotten

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.080
Fine. Here, here.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.440
See? You gotta go here,

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.380
and then watch your timing
when you get here...

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.050
Oh!

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.030
Eh?

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.600
Ah!

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.480
Sorry!

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.030
It's... okay. That was my fault, too.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.290
I'm really sorry.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.220
Um, I'm not that worried about it.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:53.790
Huh?

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.050
You aren't mad?

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.400
I am a little surprised, but not mad.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.510
It's not like you're a stranger.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.550
Mahiru, you're leaning!

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.450
What the heck? She's so cute!

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.790
You really don't need to lean like that.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.880
I-I wasn't doing it on purpose!

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.550
Yeah, I know. But you were still leaning.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.710
Are you making fun of me?

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.770
No, no, it was just so funny to watch.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.060
So you are making fun of me!

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.310
Would I make fun of
someone who's trying so hard?

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.750
No, I don't think so...

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.210
Right? I just thought it was cute.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:08.240
"Cute" meaning someone who's
so childish they're funny to watch.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.790
Hey, ow—

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.080
Ouch?

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.490
Amane-kun, you dummy!

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.550
I won!

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.600
Good for you. I could tell
you were really trying.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.070
Yes! Thank you very much!

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.610
It was so fun, I really got into it!

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.670
Here's your prize for winning first place.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.530
Um, you really don't need to.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.540
If you don't want a prize,

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:55.540
then just pretend it's something that old,
round guy with the big beard left with me.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:56.900
Oh.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.170
You can open it.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.300
Okay.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.250
I mean, it isn't anything special.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.890
Oh!

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.020
It's a key case.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.390
Because I lent you my key, you know.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.650
If you don't want to use it, that's fine.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.730
No, I'll be very happy to use it.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.530
Amane-kun, you have a better
sense of style than I thought.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.610
What do you mean, better than you thought?

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.340
Well, your everyday clothes
are nowhere near stylish.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.450
It sounds like you looked
pretty sharp in junior high, though.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.500
That's because Mom made me...

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.540
Wait, how do you know?

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:42.920
Shihoko-san sent me a picture and said,
"This is what he looks like cleaned up."

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.840
Why that little...

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.660
They did exchange contact info that day.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.080
It didn't look good on me anyway.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.560
I wonder about that.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:14:01.060
Amane-kun, your bangs hide it, but I think
you have really handsome features.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.560
What?

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.620
Ah, nothing. Your eyes
seem brighter than before.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.560
Well, I can't deny that.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.700
But now it's your turn.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.630
Um... So...

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.860
I have a Christmas present for you, too.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.610
It's super warm!

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.860
And it feels so soft!

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.120
I'm glad you like it.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.480
Hmm? What is it?

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.830
Well, I was just thinking you look a lot
less guarded now than when we first met.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.250
Do I?

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.580
Yeah, and I like it a lot more.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.570
When you smile like you did a minute ago,

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.760
I just think, you're so cute, it's a
shame you can't always smile that way.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.760
Seeing you smile such a natural smile

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.270
makes me think you're comfortable
around me, so I'm pretty hap—

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.300
Whoa!

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.360
Please, stop talking for a minute.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.320
What's going on?

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.740
Nothing at all.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.020
Are you embarrassed or something?

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.380
Please be quiet!

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.350
You'll catch a cold.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.220
Shouldn't that be my line?

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.480
That time, I just didn't take a bath
and warm up properly.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.880
I should have been more careful.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.230
If I catch you like that again,
I'll throw you into the bath myself.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.410
Are you my mom?

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.990
Honestly, I've been so grateful
these two months. Thank you.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.040
Me, too. Thank you very much.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.420
I haven't done anything, though.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.800
I'm thankful for things
you don't even realize.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:37.700
Bit by bit, I'm really starting
to like living like this.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.060
Your face is red. Do you have a fever?

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.400
I most certainly don't.
I'm just a little flushed.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.580
Then take your temperature and prove it.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:59.530
It's 37.2 degrees. A slight fever. I'm fine.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.450
Oh?

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.080
It looks like 38.4 degrees to me.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.830
Are you going to overdo it
while you let me just slack off?

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:15.260
It's winter break, so you should relax.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
She's so stubborn.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.350
A-Amane-kun?

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:29.530
I know you'll push it,
so I'm watching you until you sleep.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:30.960
Huh?

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.110
Uh...

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.010
Y-You can't go into a girl's room!

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.530
If you don't like that,
you can sleep in my room.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.030
Isn't there some other option?

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:44.150
You should have accepted your
need to rest from the start.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:49.040
So, what'll it be? My place or yours, Mahiru?

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.600
What if I say neither?

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.220
Then I'll force my way into your
apartment and throw you into bed myself.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.460
Then your room is fine.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.190
You took your medicine, so now just rest up.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.450
You sure worked fast.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.940
I'm just doing the same thing you did for me.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.700
I mean, why were you trying
to push yourself in the first place?

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.450
It's my fault for not taking care of myself.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.610
Even with utmost diligence,
it's still possible to catch a cold.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:30.040
You're always working too hard anyway.
You're probably exhausted.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.420
But I know that's my fault,
so I really should apologize.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.170
Amane-kun, I've never thought
of you as a burden.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.720
Is that right?

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.320
But even then, this is a perfect
chance for you to get s—

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.980
Good night.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.390
I'm not a child, you know.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.590
I know.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:08.250
I'm holding on and watching
so you don't run away. Just relax.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.790
Since it has come to this,
I will not try to flee.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.690
I wonder about that.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.250
Come on. If you want me
to let go, hurry up and sleep.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:38.580
Yes?

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.200
Good morning. How are you feeling?

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.260
Don't lie to me now.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.200
Still a little groggy.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.800
Okay. Do you want rice porridge again?

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.020
I bought some pudding and gelatin, too.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.280
Really, I'm... so sorry for the troub—

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.090
Quit apologizing. You did this for me, too.

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.720
So, pudding or gelatin. Which do you want?

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.470
Gelatin.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.470
Okey-dokey. Think you can eat rice porridge?

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.220
Sure.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.670
Do you need me to do anything else?

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.100
Not right now.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.020
Okay.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:23.440
Amane-kun?

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.950
I've got nothing better to do.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.520
Wanna talk for a while until you get sleepy?

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.420
Huh?

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.580
Sure.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.490
Nobody's ever looked after me like this.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.390
Koyuki-san always went home
at the end of the day.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:40.730
Koyuki-san?

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.800
The housekeeper when I lived at home.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.050
Oh.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:51.060
Morning and night, I was always alone.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.940
Well, I'm here for today.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.770
If you don't get well soon,
it's a problem for me, too.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.850
I'm so sorry for occupying
your bed, and the cooking...

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.280
That's not what I mean.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.370
I hate seeing the person
I spend all my time with get sick.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.250
Hurry up and fall asleep, okay?

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.970
Once you get your fill of sleep,
you should be better.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:17.710
Okay.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.890
Should I watch over you
until you fall asleep again today?

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.490
Yes, please do.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.170
Huh?

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.060
It was your idea, Amane-kun.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.950
I guess it was, but...

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.390
Are you going back on your word as a man?

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.560
No way.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:32.970
Come on.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.060
You're so warm.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.400
Your fever has gone down a lot.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.450
Just go to sleep.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:44.400
Okay.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.160
I'm such an idiot.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.420
Damn it.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.270
You're so bad for my heart.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:39.890
Next Time
