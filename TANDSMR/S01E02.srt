1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,980
What the heck are you doing here?

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,190
Nothing at all.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,260
If it's nothing, you wouldn't be sitting
here looking like you lost your way.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,420
Did something happen?

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,070
Not really.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,710
There's hair all over your uniform.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,870
Were you playing with a
dog or cat or something?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,710
I wasn't playing! I just...

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,100
I wanted to rescue a cat
that was stuck in this tree.

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,390
Oh, so that's what happened.

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,200
Stay right there. Don't you dare move.

12
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,490
Crus—

13
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,490
Easy to tear by hand

14
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,490
Surgical Tape

15
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,490
...for cuts and scratches...

16
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,490
World-Famous...

17
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,490
Shiina. Take off your tights.

18
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,460
Huh?

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,550
Come on, don't look at me like that.

20
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,210
Here. You can use my jacket and I'll
turn around, so take off your tights.

21
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,960
After we ice your injury,
I'll put a compress on it.

22
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,170
How could you tell?

23
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,780
Because you have one shoe half off
and you haven't tried to stand up.

24
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,350
Spraining your foot while saving a cat.
What a cliché story.

25
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,920
Oh, you be quiet!

26
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,020
Fine, fine.

27
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,850
Go on. Take off your tights
and let me see your foot.

28
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,160
Surgical

29
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,160
...with World-Famous Water

30
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,160
Crushed

31
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,670
Does it feel any better?

32
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,620
Well, a little bit.

33
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,300
Okay, I'll put the compress on.

34
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,240
Don't get mad and call me
a pervert or anything.

35
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,840
I would never say something
that rude to my rescuer!

36
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,850
That's a relief.

37
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,320
You're surprisingly good at that.

38
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,690
Yeah, I can treat minor injuries.

39
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,100
Can't cook, though.

40
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,530
That should be good.

41
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,900
Math

42
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,860
Yes?

43
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,860
Look at your foot.

44
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,240
I don't think you can wear tights
on top of a compress.

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,470
Don't worry, they're clean.

46
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,420
Here, this too.

47
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,070
Huh?

48
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,510
You want people to see you
getting carried around?

49
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,810
Excuse me?

50
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,600
Sorry about this.

51
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,650
It's no trouble.

52
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,390
Even I'm enough of a gentleman

53
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,770
that I wouldn't abandon an
injured person or make them walk.

54
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,030
Thank you very much for today.
You really saved me.

55
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,160
No problem.

56
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,890
Okay, take care.

57
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,870
Fujimiya

58
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,410
Oh...

59
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,280
Hey, Amane...

60
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,050
Were you always so hot-blooded
that you wore shorts all year?

61
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,840
Oh, come on. I forgot my sweats.

62
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,810
What a derp!

63
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,790
Shove it.

64
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,730
Next!

65
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,160
Kadowaki-kun, go for it!

66
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,620
Our prince!

67
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,120
The prince is as popular as always.

68
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,000
He just waved at me!

69
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,640
Yeah, I guess.

70
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,240
You don't seem to care much.

71
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,620
No. For classmates, we've barely even talked.

72
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,290
Damn it.

73
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,820
That jerk.

74
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,750
But "prince" and "angel" and all that...

75
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,430
Our school sure has some
embarrassing nickn—

76
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,280
See that? The angel just smiled at me!

77
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,960
No, at me!

78
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,930
Yes! I'll show Shiina-san what I'm made of!

79
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,860
Thank you for your help yesterday.

80
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,900
Here's your meal and the clothes you lent me.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,110
How are you feeling?

82
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,910
The pain is already mostly gone.

83
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,740
But I'm avoiding exercise
until I recover fully.

84
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,950
You're still a super popular angel, though.

85
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,640
Huh?

86
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,100
That one little smile
lit a fire under those guys.

87
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,420
I asked you to please stop calling me that!

88
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,050
But that was bewildering to me, too.

89
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,880
Does it really make them that happy?

90
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,470
Yeah, most guys would freak out
if a beautiful girl smiled at them.

91
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,460
Girls, too, right? They were squealing
after Kadowaki waved at them.

92
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,260
Kadowaki?

93
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,610
Oh, that very popular person?

94
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,900
You're not at all interested in him?

95
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,100
Not really.

96
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,490
Different class and all that.

97
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,490
Huh. Is that how it works?

98
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,910
If looking good is all it takes
for other people to develop feelings,

99
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,540
then shouldn't you
develop feelings for me, too?

100
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,120
So you're aware of how cute you are.

101
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,100
It'd be impossible to ignore
the way everyone fawns over me.

102
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,560
Also, objectively speaking,
I know I have good features,

103
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,800
and I've never neglected my appearance.

104
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,240
Quite so.

105
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,280
Today's looks special!

106
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,640
That's for helping me out.

107
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,400
You really didn't have to...

108
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,770
There's korokke?! Did you make it?

109
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,840
I did.

110
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,720
Please reheat it in the
microwave before you eat.

111
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,780
Thank you!

112
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,910
But, you know... I'd love to eat it
freshly made sometime.

113
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,950
Are you trying to come over?

114
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,890
Huh?

115
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,520
Ah, that's not what I meant!

116
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,060
I wouldn't be that pushy when you've
been kind enough to share with me.

117
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,670
Let's split it.

118
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,880
If we split the cost, and I can cook
at your place, I'll consider it.

119
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,630
Huh?

120
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,080
Oh...

121
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,870
Splitting the cost would
actually be ideal for me, too,

122
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,690
especially since I've been
mooching off of you all this time.

123
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,690
But aren't you afraid for your safety?

124
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,780
If you dare make a move,

125
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,290
I'll crush them. Literally.

126
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,050
They'll never work again.

127
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,790
Oh, god! You terrified them into hiding!

128
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,670
You understand the risk now,
so I doubt you'll try anything.

129
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,670
And I believe you understand
the position I hold at school, too.

130
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,880
If I tried anything, I'd get pulverized.

131
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,050
Another thing...

132
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,680
What is it?

133
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,760
I don't think I'm your type anyway.

134
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,730
What if you had been my type?

135
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,700
Then you'd probably be
pestering me all the time.

136
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,330
And then I would have
stayed far away from you.

137
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,490
So I guess I made the grade.

138
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,950
Well, I can at least acknowledge
that you're not a threat.

139
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,330
That's good to know.

140
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:45,000
In order for Shiina to cook at my place,
we decided on a few conditions.

141
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,570
In addition to paying
half the cost of the ingredients,

142
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,020
I pay her a little extra for the labor.

143
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,180
Fujimiya

144
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,590
If we have other plans
and can't eat together,

145
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,310
we let each other know one day ahead.

146
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,910
And we share the work
of shopping and cleaning up.

147
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,530
They look brand new,
like they've never been used before.

148
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,360
Shut up.

149
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,360
I took the liberty of selecting the menu
myself today. Is that all right?

150
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,160
As long as it's edible,
I'm good with anything.

151
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,300
I'm going to start cooking now,
so please go wait in the living room.

152
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,300
Will do.

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,700
I know there's nothing I can help with.

154
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,550
You're certainly taking this gracefully.

155
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,720
Since you can't cook, I wouldn't want
you hovering over me anyway.

156
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,970
You sure don't mince words.

157
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,640
Because it's the truth.
There's no reason to pretend otherwise.

158
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,240
Why do I feel like I've found my wife?

159
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,490
You aren't thinking something gross, are you?

160
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,500
Q-Quit imagining weird stuff!

161
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,500
Thank you for waiting.

162
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,920
Please help yourself.

163
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,420
Wow, it looks delicious!

164
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,570
Thank you for saying that.

165
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,230
Please begin, before it gets cold.

166
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,080
Thank you for the food.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,770
It's great!

168
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,270
Thank you very much.

169
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,750
You certainly seem to be enjoying it.

170
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,450
Because it's honestly delicious.

171
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,930
It's good to show
appreciation for delicious food.

172
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,300
Yes, I guess so...

173
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,150
Also, instead of eating in silence,

174
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,050
wouldn't we both feel better
if I'm up front about how good it is?

175
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,020
I think you're right.

176
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,640
Fujimiya-san?

177
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,540
Ahh! No, it's nothing.

178
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,550
Thank you very much.

179
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,370
You are very welcome.

180
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,900
It was delicious.

181
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,600
I could tell by looking at you.

182
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,880
But it almost feels too good to be true.

183
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,960
Is it really okay for me to dine
with you like this every day?

184
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,590
If it wasn't, I wouldn't have suggested it.

185
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,010
Even so, is it normal to cook
for a guy you don't even like?

186
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,640
I do it because you have
such an unhealthy lifestyle!

187
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,860
Also, I just really like cooking,

188
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,150
and I don't mind watching you eat
since you seem to enjoy it so much.

189
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,660
Yeah, but still...

190
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:03,370
If it bothers you that much,
I don't need to cook.

191
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,030
No! Please keep cooking!

192
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,150
Then please accept it openly.

193
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,770
Sure.

194
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,970
The Angel Next Door
Spoils Me Rotten

195
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,530
All right, time's up.

196
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,390
Pass your tests up from the back.

197
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,930
It's over, it's over!

198
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,860
Oh, man...

199
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,580
That was too hard!

200
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,520
Amane! How'd you do?

201
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,620
Normal.

202
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,990
Not great, not horrible.

203
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,410
But you still managed to squeeze into
the top 30 scores. You intellectual, you.

204
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,540
That's because I'm not always
so busy flirting that I forget to study.

205
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,610
Having a girlfriend is great, though!

206
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,730
Yeah, sure.

207
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,460
You're such a bland guy.

208
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,150
I bet you'd change
if you met a girl you like.

209
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,590
Ikkun!

210
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,310
Oh, Chi!

211
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,730
Let's go home!

212
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,770
You're really shameless with the PDA.

213
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,590
Patting your cute girlfriend's
head is totally normal.

214
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,230
That's beyond comprehension.

215
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,380
Nah, nah. You're the type of guy who
would totally dote on his girlfriend.

216
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,960
Huh? What?!

217
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,400
Amane has a girlfriend?!

218
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,020
No way.

219
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,820
Aww, why not?

220
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,410
If you did, I'd wanna be close friends.

221
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,050
Your friendship gets a little too close.

222
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,340
I'd feel bad for my imaginary girlfriend.

223
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,380
What?! You have an imaginary girlfriend?!

224
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,510
We were talking about if I got one...

225
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,260
Thank you for washing the dishes.

226
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:51,930
Sure.

227
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,720
What are you doing there?

228
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,350
I'm grading.

229
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,520
Well, I can see that.

230
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,750
So what's your score?

231
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,960
As long as my essay is right,
it should be perfect.

232
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,900
Why am I not surprised?

233
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,420
I like studying well enough.

234
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,760
And I've studied ahead and already
covered next year's curriculum.

235
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,440
Yikes! That's crazy.

236
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,790
Nice work.

237
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,630
But you do a decent amount of
studying, too, don't you, Fujimiya-san?

238
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,340
Did you see my scores?

239
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,010
I can more or less remember the people who
rank high enough to have their names posted.

240
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,740
Well, that's one condition for me
living alone. Maintaining my grades.

241
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,140
I study enough to stay out of trouble,
but not as much as you.

242
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,840
You sure work hard.

243
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,730
I work hard because I have to.

244
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,530
It's about time for me to be on my way.

245
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,960
Yeah.

246
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,670
Hey!

247
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,210
Full Name

248
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,210
Date of Birth

249
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,210
December 6

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,670
Here. You dropped it.

251
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,210
Student ID

252
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,540
Oh, sorry for the trouble.

253
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,410
Well then, have a good night.

254
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,040
Good night.

255
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,420
Her birthday is in four days.

256
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,270
Huh?

257
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,740
I just mean, is there anything you want?

258
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,150
Why ask all of a sudden?

259
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:34,070
Well, you don't seem to need
a lot of things. I was just curious.

260
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,100
So blunt again...

261
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,700
Hmm. Let me think.

262
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,460
What do I need...

263
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,570
What I want is...

264
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,290
Oh!

265
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,710
Sharpening Stone

266
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,710
A sharpening stone.

267
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,300
Sharpening stone?!

268
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,270
I already have several, but I want
one with a finer grit, you know?

269
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,720
Are you really a high school girl?!

270
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,600
Please don't expect me to behave
like a typical high school girl.

271
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,520
A high school girl who sharpens knives?
How could this be?

272
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,210
I guess I'm a rare find. Lucky for you.

273
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,130
Good morning.

274
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,360
Yeah, good morning.

275
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,610
Hmm. A birthday present?

276
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,440
You know, it's important to do
research into that sort of thing.

277
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,300
It's the key to a good
relationship. Really is.

278
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,330
I told you, she isn't my girlfriend.

279
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,980
Well, it depends on how close you are,

280
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,170
but trinkets and consumables
are usually safe.

281
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,700
That makes sense.

282
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,550
Also, hand cream never fails to please.

283
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,640
It's pretty useful at any age
and it doesn't go bad quickly.

284
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,750
Hand cream, huh?

285
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,320
What's that, what's that?

286
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,250
A birthday present?
You're giving it to a girl, right?

287
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,580
Tell me all about her!

288
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,380
She's a female acquaintance
of mine who's relatively young.

289
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,200
Beyond that, I exercise
my right to remain silent.

290
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,240
But you know, if I have no clue
about her style or personality,

291
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,290
I can't give you helpful advice.

292
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,460
Just go with your instincts.

293
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,210
What gift do you think
would make a girl happy?

294
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,210
Fine, I can see you don't want to tell.

295
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,750
Hmm. What would be good?

296
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,050
I don't know what kind of
relationship you have,

297
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,290
but for an acquaintance
you're fine talking to...

298
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,820
If you want something casual,

299
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,560
you could try candy or a handkerchief
or a bag or something small.

300
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,920
If you gave me some kind of fancy accessory,

301
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,160
I'd think, "What is this? A bribe?" Probably.

302
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,200
What would I ever bribe you for?

303
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,020
So, small trinkets and
things are probably safe.

304
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,660
Also, cute stuff, you know?

305
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,760
Like stuffed animals.

306
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,200
Stuffed animals?

307
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,340
Oh? You like that one?

308
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,880
But a guy my age carrying
a stuffed animal to the counter...

309
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,840
Don't be a coward!

310
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,300
Chitose.

311
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,100
Would you...

312
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,600
Would I?

313
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,820
Please come shopping with me?!

314
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,230
Well, I don't know...

315
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,080
Please. I'm begging you!

316
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,690
Hmm... I guess I could go along with you.

317
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,210
By the way, Amane-kun, I'm kinda
in the mood for something sweet.

318
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,810
Crêpes?

319
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,800
Please allow me to treat you!

320
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,020
Yeah, sure! I'll order the deluxe one!

321
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,790
For you.

322
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,720
What's all this about?

323
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,910
It's your birthday, isn't it?

324
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,480
It is, but...

325
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,990
Would you mind explaining how you knew?

326
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,120
I don't believe I've told anybody at all.

327
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,680
Your school ID.

328
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,140
Remember how you dropped it the other day?

329
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,840
Oh.

330
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,860
You should have just ignored it.

331
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,050
I never celebrate my birthday anyway.

332
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,220
Fine, then.

333
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,320
Then take it as a token of gratitude.

334
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,270
Let's just say I thought
that I owed you something.

335
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,540
Is it all right if I open it?

336
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,760
I'm sorry it isn't anything special,

337
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,750
but you do all that housework for me,

338
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,320
and this looks like it's
really good for the hands.

339
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,210
That's very practical.

340
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,270
I think it's safe to say you usually
lean toward practical things.

341
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,010
I think you're right. Thank you very much.

342
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,220
But there's something else in the bag.

343
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,320
That's just, you know,
a bonus item I picked out on a whim.

344
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,000
A bear?

345
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,050
So, if you don't like it,
you can get rid of it.

346
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,120
I would never do that!

347
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,700
O-Oh.

348
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,580
Yeah, that doesn't sound
like something you'd do.

349
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,610
I would never do something so cruel.

350
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,760
I'll cherish it.

351
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,450
I shouldn't have looked!

352
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,980
Damn it.

353
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,510
I've never received something
like this before.

354
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,340
Huh?

355
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,480
But girls as popular as you
usually get buried in gifts.

356
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,820
Do you really think of me like...

357
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,940
I've never told anyone my birthday.

358
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,740
Because I hate birthdays.

359
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,200
Normally, I get nervous about receiving
presents and things from strangers

360
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,630
and people I don't know well,
so I don't accept them.

361
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,840
But you're accepting this.

362
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,600
Because, Fujimiya-san, you're not a stranger.

363
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,470
Patting your cute girlfriend's
head is totally normal.

364
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,660
What is it?

365
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,660
No, it's nothing.

366
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,580
That was close!

367
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,460
Thank you very much, Fujimiya-san.

368
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,010
Dinner with the Angel

369
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,980
Next Time
