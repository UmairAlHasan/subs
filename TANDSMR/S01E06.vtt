WEBVTT

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:32.926
And so...

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.928
I want to ask you something.

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:37.597
You know the big day in February, right?

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:39.474
Do you mean the final exam?

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:45.855
{\an8}How can a high school guy in the best part
of his life always think about exams?

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.150
I don't know if this is
the best part of my life.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.861
But it's normal to think of
exams as a student.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:55.949
{\an8}Any high school guy enjoying
his youth would think of Valentine's Day.

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.868
I'm not enjoying it, so I wouldn't know.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:02.455
Stop it.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.084
So?

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.419
What is it you wanted to ask?

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:13.258
I'm wondering what kind of
chocolate to give to Itsuki.

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:17.011
In middle school, I just melted the
chocolate and hardened it again.

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:20.640
But as a high schooler, I should
do something a little fancy.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.226
Why don't you just ask Shiina about it?

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.770
I will ask her too.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.897
But you are a guy after all.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.732
I want your opinion on this.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:33.444
What do you mean after all?
I am a guy, obviously.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:38.408
I think a real guy would try to
flirt with a girl when they are alone.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:50.545
That can only happen
when the girl feels comfortable.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.798
{\an8}And we are not even in
that kind of relationship.

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:57.135
I guess you are well brought up, Amane.

00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:59.012
You understand healthy boundaries.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:04.183
{\an8}<i>I'd be lying if I said that I didn't
have any feelings toward Mahiru.</i>

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.562
<i>But still...</i>

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:10.523
<i>I'm not so stupid as to act on them.</i>

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.485
{\an8}<i>I don't want to make her cry or hate me.</i>

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:19.532
{\an8}<i>Because those are the feelings
she's bound to have.</i>

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.210
I'll remember to give you
some chocolate as well.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.462
What kind do you like?

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.298
I don't really care for sweet stuff.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.634
Just don't make it too sweet.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.886
{\an8}Not too sweet?

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:40.803
{\an8}Got it.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.555
{\an8}I'll add different things inside.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.265
{\an8}Don't add anything strange in it.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.560
{\an8}Don't worry, it's all edible.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.395
Geez...

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.856
Who will you give chocolate to, Mahiru?

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.776
To some of my girlfriends in class.

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.111
Not to any guy?

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:02.033
{\an8}There would be unnecessary
commotion if I did.

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:05.495
{\an8}I will give you one too.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.538
{\an8}You are the best!

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:09.457
{\an8}I'll give you some too.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.168
{\an8}I'll give you proper chocolate,
unlike what I'll give Amane.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.086
Oi.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.545
I'm just kidding.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:18.216
{\an8}I'll make sure yours is edible too.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.387
Being edible is completely
different from being delicious.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.806
Look forward to it.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.945
This is for you, Kadowaki.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.155
Please accept my chocolate.

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.284
I made these for you too.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.827
Kadowaki.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.620
These are for you as well.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:50.373
Thank you.

00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:52.792
Taste mine first.

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:56.004
-No, have mine first.
-I was here first.

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:58.548
Isn't that amazing?

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:01.050
He's the popular one.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.803
The other guys are gritting
their teeth as we speak.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.180
It's not easy for a popular guy.

00:05:06.764 --> 00:05:09.684
It'll take lots of effort to
bring those back home.

00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:11.936
This has always been the case
since middle school.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.938
It's amazing that he never gains weight.

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:16.316
He's in the track team after all.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:20.111
I would never have to worry about
gaining weight from chocolate.

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:24.032
Chi has made your chocolate.

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:25.241
Be prepared.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.577
What do you mean prepared?

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:29.829
<i>Russian roulette.</i>

00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:31.372
What did she put in it?

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:35.543
One chocolate with habanero,
wasabi, and pepper.

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:39.088
One with <i>umeboshi</i> extracts jelly.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:41.299
And all the rest are normal.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.761
What is she doing?

00:05:45.803 --> 00:05:49.807
By the way,
will you get chocolate from that girl?

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:52.810
{\an8}I don't know.

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:55.938
I haven't seen any sign of it yet.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:59.317
SEIJO HIGH SCHOOL

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.652
Amane, this is for you.

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.613
Thank you.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.823
Itsuki must have told you.

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:07.575
But look forward to what's inside.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.579
{\an8}I don't really like spicy stuff.

00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:14.624
{\an8}There are some super sweet
and super bitter one's as well.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.920
{\an8}Thank you for telling me in advance.

00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:21.964
{\an8}Chi, don't you think it's too...

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.132
{\an8}It's fine.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.259
{\an8}There are some
palate cleansers in there too.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:26.385
Palate cleansers?

00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:30.139
We are going then, bye.

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.059
Good luck.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:34.602
Hurry up, Itsuki.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:41.651
Kadowaki.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.822
Fujimiya, what is it?

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.698
Nothing much.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:48.616
Here.

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:52.870
That's what I use for shopping.

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:56.082
Isn't it what you were looking for?

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:58.459
No, you are right...

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.044
I see.

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:02.296
It must be tough. Good luck.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:19.772
Did you hit the jackpot?

00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:23.234
I've been trying to finish them
over the last few days.

00:07:23.317 --> 00:07:24.610
Look at me now.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.028
Sorry to hear that.

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:30.741
But if you've seen hell already,
all the rest is heaven.

00:07:31.492 --> 00:07:33.661
Here, drink this to wash it down.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:35.496
Cocoa?

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.414
Similar stuff.

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:38.040
This is <i>chocolat chaud</i>...

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:41.169
So basically, hot chocolate.

00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:42.587
You saved me.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:47.383
It's good.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.845
I'm glad to hear.

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:56.392
I didn't know you can
make hot chocolate though.

00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:58.728
You usually make hot milk, right?

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.814
{\an8}Yeah... I guess.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.985
Did you make this for Valentine's Day?

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:07.737
{\an8}Yeah.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.285
{\an8}Thanks. You are my savior.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:19.165
It's really good.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.043
What's wrong?

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.087
Well... I...

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.097
I'm going home.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.435
<i>What did I do?</i>

00:08:50.821 --> 00:08:54.408
<i>This is my gesture of gratitude
for being in your care all this time.</i>

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:08.047
<i>It seems you dislike sweet food.</i>

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:10.424
<i>So I made something easy to eat.</i>

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:14.679
<i>These are called</i> orangettes<i>,
and I hope they suit your tastes.</i>

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:19.141
I don't really care for sweet stuff.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.519
Just don't make it too sweet.

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:29.652
Mahiru...

00:09:39.203 --> 00:09:40.037
So delicious.

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:42.915
-Morning!
-Morning.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:43.916
Yesterday...

00:09:45.209 --> 00:09:46.294
Fujimiya.

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:49.630
Kadowaki and Fujimiya?

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.424
Why are they together?

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:53.050
That's rare to see.

00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:56.762
I thought Fujimiya only
ever talked to Akasawa.

00:09:57.346 --> 00:09:58.598
Thanks for the help yesterday.

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:00.600
No worries.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.727
It must have been tough for you.

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:05.688
{\an8}It's fine.

00:10:06.814 --> 00:10:07.857
Anyway, you helped me out.

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:10.026
I just wanted to say thank you.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.027
Don't worry about it.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.988
We should help each other
out when we are in trouble.

00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:15.031
Don't worry.

00:10:16.073 --> 00:10:16.907
{\an8}Thanks.

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:21.287
I'm going to swoon!

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:23.164
Amane.

00:10:24.248 --> 00:10:26.292
Did you help Yuta with something?

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.712
He was overwhelmed by the amount of
chocolate he received.

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:32.590
So I gave him my shopping bag.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:37.219
I guess he received more than he expected.
How naive.

00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:40.890
So you have shopping bags
with you at all times?

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.850
Looks like you're raising a household.

00:10:42.933 --> 00:10:46.062
{\an8}I guess I'm being influenced
by a certain somebody.

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:48.856
It's great to have a partner
that can take care of the house.

00:10:48.939 --> 00:10:50.441
She's not my partner.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.070
How's Chitose with household chores?

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:54.987
Chi?

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.156
Well...

00:10:57.239 --> 00:11:00.409
If she doesn't act on
any strange impulses,

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:03.120
I guess she probably can manage it.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.998
You mean she's capable of
not doing anything crazy?

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:09.460
That's what makes her cute though.

00:11:09.543 --> 00:11:11.504
Don't look away.

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:14.673
She said she'll get her act together
when we get married.

00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:18.427
God knows how long it'll
take for your dad to approve.

00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:23.766
It's rare nowadays to see parents
who are so strict about dating.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.646
He was displeased to know that
we plan to get married in the future.

00:11:28.729 --> 00:11:31.857
I'll try to convince him
when I'm an adult.

00:11:32.441 --> 00:11:35.653
{\an8}I know you're not going to
give up until he gives up.

00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:36.570
{\an8}Do your best.

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:38.197
{\an8}You too.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.033
For what?

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:43.744
You and her, right?

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:48.457
We are not in that sort of relationship.

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:51.001
FUJIMIYA

00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:03.431
I'm back.

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:05.224
Welcome home.

00:12:05.307 --> 00:12:07.435
Thanks for yesterday.
It was really tasty.

00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:09.437
That's good.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.813
What do you want in return?

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.859
{\an8}I didn't give you that for a return gift.

00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:16.610
I know.

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:18.988
I would like to repay your kindness.

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:22.366
It's embarrassing for a guy
not to give anything back.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.620
{\an8}I have received lots from you.

00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:29.707
Actually, you've done so much for me.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.126
You cook for me all the time.

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:34.670
You're always taking care of me.

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:38.257
I do it because I like it.

00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:42.761
You probably don't realize
what you've done for me.

00:12:43.637 --> 00:12:47.183
{\an8}But I felt it. So that's sufficient.

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:50.769
But that's a different story.

00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:53.022
Well, I'll think of
something you'll like.

00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:55.900
{\an8}Okay.

00:12:55.983 --> 00:12:59.612
Don't get your hopes too high though.

00:12:59.695 --> 00:13:00.529
Okay.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.741
I'll cherish whatever you give me.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.910
Don't exaggerate...

00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:08.954
{\an8}I cherish that teddy bear.

00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:10.706
Teddy bear...

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:15.961
{\an8}I'm glad.

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:23.385
Speaking of gifts, I don't know
when your birthday is.

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:25.179
My birthday?

00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:27.973
It's November 8th.

00:13:31.727 --> 00:13:33.062
{\an8}Amane.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:37.233
{\an8}We had already
known each other by then, right?

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:38.567
Yeah.

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.611
So why didn't you tell me?

00:13:40.694 --> 00:13:41.654
You didn't ask.

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:44.365
You never told me your birthday too.

00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:46.825
I only found out from your student ID.

00:13:48.744 --> 00:13:51.830
{\an8}Anyway, we weren't as
close as we are now.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:56.544
{\an8}It would've been strange
if I mentioned my birthday then...

00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:57.545
{\an8}Well then...

00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:03.884
{\an8}I'll celebrate your birthday this year.

00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:11.392
{\an8}Are you promising
to stay with me until then?

00:14:18.607 --> 00:14:22.319
I don't... dislike you...

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:26.657
{\an8}I feel comfortable being with you.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.326
{\an8}I see. Thanks.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.871
{\an8}I don't mean anything by it.

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:37.001
Of course, I know that.

00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:56.896
May I help you?

00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:04.069
I'm looking for something appropriate
to gift for White Day.

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:05.654
{\an8}I'm all ears.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:09.658
{\an8}She's not a girlfriend.
But we are rather close.

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:16.373
{\an8}Do people appreciate receiving jewelry
from someone other than their lover?

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:21.921
I think it'll be alright
if you are close friends.

00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:26.800
May I recommend you
a few popular items among the ladies?

00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:28.135
Yes, please.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.059
Why did you change your hairstyle?

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:38.145
Today is White Day after all.

00:15:38.854 --> 00:15:40.648
Did I make it too formal?

00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:42.608
I thought I should dress up a bit.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:46.820
<i>Did I mess it up?</i>

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.281
I can change it back if you don't like it.

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:50.199
No.

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:54.161
It's okay. I was just a little shocked.

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:57.289
I see.

00:16:05.547 --> 00:16:07.591
I should change it back
if it makes you uncomfortable.

00:16:08.258 --> 00:16:10.928
No, just keep it like that.

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:13.514
It's just...

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:16.308
It's just that you look
unnecessarily handsome.

00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:18.894
Unnecessarily?

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:22.815
{\an8}Your usual style makes me more relieved.

00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:24.817
{\an8}I feel nervous seeing you like this...

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:26.652
I'll go change it then.

00:16:33.742 --> 00:16:35.119
{\an8}No, just keep it.

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.332
This is my return gift.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:43.127
Don't have too much hope though.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.087
Thank you.

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.006
Can I open it now?

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:48.549
Yeah.

00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:59.268
Um...

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:01.186
You don't like it?

00:17:01.937 --> 00:17:02.938
{\an8}Yes, I do like it.

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:04.690
{\an8}It's lovely.

00:17:06.108 --> 00:17:07.192
That's good.

00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:11.363
I chose this one because
I thought it'd suit you.

00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:13.699
Thank you.

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:16.785
What's this?

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:18.746
Ah, that?

00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:22.791
I thought a bracelet wouldn't be enough.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.418
I've been in your care all this while.

00:17:24.501 --> 00:17:26.503
The least I can do is grant your wish.

00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:29.506
I'll do anything you want coupon.

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:34.386
{\an8}Did you draw this yourself?

00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:36.138
Shut up.

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.264
I know I'm bad at it, okay?

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:40.934
It's very you.

00:17:48.108 --> 00:17:49.860
Can I use the coupon now?

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:51.320
What would you like?

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:56.617
Please help me put this on.

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:00.788
I'll do it even without
the coupon though.

00:18:01.872 --> 00:18:03.207
Leave it to me.

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:16.720
It suits you well.

00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:20.849
Thank you very much.

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:32.861
<i>Unbearable...</i>

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:35.322
Was she happy?

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:36.740
I guess.

00:18:37.699 --> 00:18:40.702
Your reaction means it went well.

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:44.498
I guess you caught her fancy
and saw her adorable smile.

00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:57.511
See? You two are becoming closer.

00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:01.098
I'm pretty happy about it.

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:03.517
Seems like the god of love
has finally come to you.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.726
It's not like that.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.563
But it's possible
that she like you, right?

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:09.314
It's not possible.

00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:12.151
As your friend, I'll make a prediction.

00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:13.068
What?

00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:15.237
You'll change someday.

00:19:15.904 --> 00:19:18.282
Actually, you are showing
signs of it already.

00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:20.284
All that's left is for you
to take the next step.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.120
You talk like you know me.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.040
How many years have we been friends?

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:28.625
Not even a year.

00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:30.085
Anyway,

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:35.382
{\an8}you are always saying
you're not a match for her.

00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:37.509
{\an8}But your words and attitude

00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:40.053
{\an8}basically mean that you
have feelings for her.

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:44.683
Shut up or I'll shove
the fries up your nose.

00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:46.018
Sorry.

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:54.526
You came home late today.

00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:57.779
{\an8}<i>Are you some newlywed wife?</i>

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:00.949
I went to have fries with Itsuki.

00:20:03.243 --> 00:20:05.037
But it's dinner time.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.414
Don't worry. I'll finish everything.

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:09.541
You are not worried about getting fat?

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:10.667
Well...

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:15.881
It might be better for you to gain
some weight since you are so thin.

00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:19.384
You are the one who
should gain some flesh.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.178
I'm worried about you.

00:20:21.261 --> 00:20:23.263
I'm stronger than I look.

00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:24.348
Are you sure?

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:27.893
Look. That's how thin you are.

00:20:31.104 --> 00:20:32.105
Sorry.

00:20:33.273 --> 00:20:35.234
You must hate people
touching you like that.

00:20:35.817 --> 00:20:37.152
{\an8}No.

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:40.239
{\an8}I don't hate it if it's you.

00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:47.496
{\an8}Not that I want you to touch me.

00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:51.708
{\an8}I just don't want other guys to touch me.

00:20:58.048 --> 00:20:58.882
Oh, by the way...

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.677
You aren't wearing the bracelet?

00:21:03.178 --> 00:21:05.472
No, I'm not demanding that you do.

00:21:05.555 --> 00:21:07.891
It's a bit inconvenient to
wear it while doing housework

00:21:08.558 --> 00:21:10.894
and it will get damaged easily that way.

00:21:10.978 --> 00:21:13.897
I want to treasure it and
only wear it on rest days.

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:15.857
I see.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.902
If you like it, I'm glad.

00:21:19.486 --> 00:21:21.613
{\an8}I do and I will cherish it.

00:21:22.572 --> 00:21:24.908
{\an8}The teddy bear, the key pouch,
and the bracelet.

00:21:25.742 --> 00:21:28.912
{\an8}I have been using the
hand cream a lot though.

00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:32.165
I'll go get changed.

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:33.125
Okay.

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:35.627
I'll be waiting, Amane.

00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:59.234
<i>She's really like a newlywed wife.</i>

00:23:30.951 --> 00:23:35.872
