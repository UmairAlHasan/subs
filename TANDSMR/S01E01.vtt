00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.310
What are you doing out here?

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.960
Fujimiya-san.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.350
Can I help you with something?

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.840
That was the first time.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.110
That was the first time
I talked to Mahiru Shiina.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.980
Meet the Angel

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.580
No, I don't need anything.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.580
It's just, if you sit out here in the rain
like this, people are gonna worry.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.820
Is that right?
Well, I appreciate your concern,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.120
but I'm here by choice,
so please don't trouble yourself over me.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.050
You'll catch a cold. Go home with this.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.410
I don't need it back.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.010
Thank you. Very... much.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.430
Seijo High School

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.450
Amane, keep it down.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.200
Weren't you fine yesterday, man?

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.580
I got caught in the rain.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.970
That's not so bad.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.780
But wait, didn't you have an umbrella?

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.750
I gave it to someone.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.010
You lent your umbrella
to someone when it was pouring?

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.590
When did you become such a softie?

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.390
Who'd you lend it to?

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.470
A lost girl I passed on the way.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.970
Well, aren't you nice.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.970
That's right.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.180
She looked like she was lost.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.770
Good morning, Shiina-san!

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.370
Good morning.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.360
Hey, hey, Shiina-san, listen to this.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.200
Sure. What is it?

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.310
The angel. She's super angelic today.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.120
Yeah.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.270
An angel.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.970
That's what everyone at school
calls Mahiru Shiina.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.750
She's attractive and graceful,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.850
gets excellent grades,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.510
First                Year

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.510
Combined 12-subject test scores for first term finals

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.510
1. Mahiru Shiina 1181 pts.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.510
2. Rika Aizawa 1142 pts.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.510
3. Masahiro Kitazawa 1113 pts.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.510
4. Akane Nishikawa 1090 pts.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.510
5. Hiroki Yusa 1025 pts.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.510
6. Kanako Hasegawa 1005 pts.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.510
7. Mikiya Suzuki 984 pts.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.510
8. Satoshi Ichijo 900 pts.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.510
9. Ryoichi Hara 871 pts.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.830
and her test scores are top of the class.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.410
And she's even good at sports.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.510
But she's still humble and modest.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.520
She's that kind of angel,
so of course she's popular.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.250
I'm sure most of the guys
in class want to date her.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.530
But that's a world I'm not part of.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.780
Don't you wish you had
a girlfriend to take care of you?

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.240
Shut up.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.750
Chitose Shirakawa

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.750
Wanna come over tonight?

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.250
Quit bragging about having one.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.250
This isn't good at all.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.730
You didn't need to bring it back.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.730
Of course I'm going to
return what I borrowed.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.190
Um, you look like you have a fever.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.870
That's none of your business.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.080
But you lent me your umbrella...

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.770
You didn't ask me to. It doesn't matter.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.090
Yes, it does!

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.090
You caught a cold
because I was sitting there.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.820
Forget about it already.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.280
You don't need to worry about me.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.760
Fujimiya

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.760
B-But I...

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.550
Just drop it. See yo—

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.850
I can't leave you alone like this.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.520
I'm going to repay the favor.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.010
I'm coming in.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.860
I hope you'll excuse me,
but there's no other way.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.290
I can't bear to look at this.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.660
I'm going to step out for a moment,
so why don't you get changed before I return.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.180
Will you do that?

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.590
You're seriously coming back?

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.260
If I leave you alone to doze off like this,
you won't sleep well.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.350
Shiina

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.350
I'd rather bite off my tongue
than tell anyone at school this,

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.600
but I started living alone in high school,
and in the same apartment complex,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.110
Shiina

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.110
literally next door, lives the angel herself.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.470
What time is it?

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.960
It's 7 p.m.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.840
You slept for about two hours.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.070
I brought it from home.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.840
Thanks for that.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.100
It's okay.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.370
Do you have an appetite?

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.290
Hmm...

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.610
Yeah, a little bit.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.400
You do?

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.740
I've made some rice porridge,
so you should have some.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.120
Huh? Your home cooking, Shiina?

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.260
If you don't want it, I'll eat it myself.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.370
Uh, no, I mean, I'll eat it! Please let me!

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.900
I'll bring it over,
so please take your temperature.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.970
Would you please at least wait
until I leave the room?!

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.620
Yeah.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.700
I never knew why the other guys
kept saying she's so cute,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.520
but I think I'm starting to get it.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.440
What was your temperature?

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.380
38.3 degrees.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.980
I'll be fine with medicine and some sleep.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.160
Over-the-counter medicine
only treats the symptoms.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.210
You need to get some proper rest

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.220
and let your immune system do its job, okay?

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.820
Here you go. It shouldn't be too hot.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.710
Thank you.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.890
What is it now?

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.540
Do you expect me to feed you?

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.230
Huh?

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.420
I regret to inform you
that is not a service I provide.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.170
Nobody even asked for that.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.440
But...

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.150
I'm just impressed that you can cook.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.300
I live alone, so of course I can.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.880
But for you, Fujimiya-san,
before learning to cook,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.290
you really should try cleaning your room.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.100
You are quite right.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.330
It's good!

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:10.980
Well, you're welcome.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.720
But rice porridge is basically
the same no matter who makes it.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:20.770
Fujimiya-san?

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.230
Uh...

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.340
Yeah, never mind.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.070
Low Calorie

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.070
Easy to Drink Sports Drink

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.540
Hey, can I ask you something?

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.400
What is it?

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.710
Why were you sitting
on that swing in the rain?

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.740
Fight with your boyfriend or something?

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:38.660
Huh?

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.380
I hate to disappoint you,
but I have no boyfriend

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.830
and no plans to get one either.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.510
Huh? Why?

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.180
I should be asking you.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.900
Why are you assuming
that I'm in a relationship?

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.290
You're so popular,
I was sure you'd have a boyfriend or two.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.320
Well, I don't.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.880
I also don't recall
ever having such loose morals

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.680
that I'd go out with multiple boys at once.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.430
That would absolutely never happen.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.380
Sorry.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.050
I didn't mean it that way.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.340
I apologize.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.990
No, I'm sorry I got that upset about it.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.490
Anyway, I was just trying
to cool my head then.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.130
But I am truly sorry
that it resulted in you catching a cold.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.620
Nah, it's fine.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.370
I didn't even ask you first.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.210
You really shouldn't feel guilty about it.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.120
I mean, we're done after this anyway, Shiina.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.630
Huh?

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:33.880
Huh?

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:43.330
Don't tell me you thought I was
guilt-tripping you to try to get lucky.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:44.340
O-Oh.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.750
I bet that's annoying even for you.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.230
If guys you don't even like
keep coming on to you.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.520
Well, it is, to be honest.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.150
I knew it.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.340
I don't really care, though.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.180
Actually, it's kind of a relief.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.270
Angels get annoyed by that
just like anyone else.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.330
Please stop calling me that!

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:12.250
Well, like I said, I won't be trying
to hang around you for no reason.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.930
Starting tomorrow,
we're basically strangers again.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.080
Good morning!

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.900
I don't want to go to math.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.070
Oh, Amane!

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.060
Are you feeling better?

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.450
Yeah, thanks a lot.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.730
Yeah, I mean, you looked like a mess.
I was getting worried.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.710
I'm glad you're better, though.
Just try to get your life together, okay?

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.780
Cleaning house, for starters.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.840
You sound just like someone I know.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.680
Huh?

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.930
Never mind.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.030
Hey!

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.020
Shiina-san, can you please explain this part?

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.810
Of course. To solve this one,
just go like this.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.490
Wow, I had no idea it was that easy!

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.030
Ah, Shiina-san, I see?

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.970
Thank you, Shiina-san!

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.980
Popular as usual, I guess.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.400
You're very welcome.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.850
She is an angel, after all.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.790
A perfectly neutral observation.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.420
For us, she's completely out of reach,
like a far-away dream.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.350
I've got no reason to talk to her.
Seeing her around is enough.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.100
What are you eating there?

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.020
A jelly drink that replenishes
energy in a few seconds.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.770
That can't possibly be your dinner, is it?

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.900
What else would it be?

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.980
You've got the appetite of a high school boy
and that's all you're eating?

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.060
Please wait right there.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:00.990
Huh?

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.490
What?

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:05.990
It's cold.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.900
Wait? For how long?

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.460
Huh?

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.170
It's only leftovers, but here.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.970
The Angel Next Door
Spoils Me Rotten

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.610
Tea

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.430
It's so good!

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.810
This is amazing, Angel!

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.070
I may be doing this for
my own personal satisfaction,

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.500
but I saw you living
such a pathetic lifestyle,

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.200
and I couldn't ignore it.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.660
Quite so.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.920
I'll happily accept it.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.250
It isn't every day that I get
to eat an angel's home cooking.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.240
Would you please stop calling me that?

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.550
Seriously.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.070
Yeah, sorry.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.560
I won't say it anymore.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:18.650
You're going to start eating well
and living properly.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.780
Sure, mom.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:27.950
So good...

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.080
Shiina

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.080
Just returning this.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.690
It was really good.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.820
Thanks for going out of your way.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.800
You even washed it for me.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.550
Well done. So...

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.290
Here you go.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.590
Huh? Yeah, no...

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.220
I just came to return the container.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.260
It's tonight's dinner.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.220
Yeah, I can see that, but...

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.880
I do need to ask,
do you have any food allergies?

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.730
I don't accept simple substitutions, though.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.540
I don't, but...

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.540
I mean, I can't accept another...

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.810
I make too much to eat by myself.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.790
I'd appreciate it if you would accept this.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.830
If that's it, then I'm happy to help.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:17.660
But normally, if you do this for someone,
they might think you have feelings for them.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.710
You think I do?

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.460
No, not a chance.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.980
Then it shouldn't be a problem.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.690
In that case, please excuse me.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.690
After that, the next day,
and the day after that,

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.530
Shiina kept handing me
containers full of food.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.250
Life was starting to get weird.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:46.380
So good...

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.070
Hey, Itsuki.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.780
Do I really look that unhealthy?

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.290
Oh, yes! Pasty white and thin as a rail,

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.600
you always look like you're not into it.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.140
Your expression just screams "unhealthy."

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:04.920
I was born with this face.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.290
Oh, I know.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.820
But why don't you try
to look a little more alive?

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.630
So that's it.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.030
I've got a dead look on my face.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.750
Yeah, but there is a little more color
in your cheeks recently.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.890
Did you change your diet or something?

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.440
Itsuki...

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.290
You're scaring me right now.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.610
Why, dude?

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.440
Wait, did I nail it?

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.990
No, well...

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.830
I was kind of forced
to mix things up, I guess.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.030
10 servings

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.030
Delicious Rice

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:37.740
Oh...

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:39.700
Oh?

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.000
Just so you know, this wasn't intentional.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.790
It's not like I'm following you.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.290
Of course I know that.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:50.070
This is obviously the closest
supermarket for both of us.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.760
Customer Appreciation Sale

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.760
Limited to one per customer

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.760
Deal!

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.300
Limited to one per customer?

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.470
So I'm buying one too?

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.340
I'm glad you're such an understanding person.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:02.850
10 servings

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:02.850
Delicious Rice

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:03.770
Tsuneno Milk

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:03.770
Rich Flavor

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.400
I didn't know you were
such a careful shopper.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.360
There's no better way to keep costs down.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.200
Well, if you're living on an allowance
from your parents, that's probably smart.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.080
I guess so.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.390
They do support me,
so it's important that I watch my budget.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.540
Tsuneno Milk

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.540
Rich Flavor

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.540
100% Milk

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.010
I'm not trying to steal it.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.700
I didn't think you were.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.430
But I can carry that much.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:42.140
In a situation like this, you'd seem a lot
more charming if you just accept the help.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.940
You make it sound like
I have no charm at all.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:48.820
I'll go ahead.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.230
I know you don't want anyone
seeing us together.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.310
Thank you very much.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.790
Fujimiya

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:07.890
Huh?!

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.710
Excuse me, but yesterday's container...

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.130
What in the world are you doing?

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.720
I was trying to clean.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.540
I just heard a really loud noise.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.930
I almost tripped.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.050
I'm not surprised.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.620
It doesn't look like
you've even started cleaning.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.790
Honestly, I don't know where to begin.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:32.770
Your room—

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:33.940
please let me clean it.

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.240
Huh?

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.660
I can't stand the thought
of my neighbor living in filth.

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:41.400
Living alone and yet you do no chores...

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.910
Do you think this is some kind of a joke?

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:48.290
You know, if you had just cleaned regularly,
it never would have come to this.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.370
'Tis as you say.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.600
Just to warn you,
I'm going to do a very thorough job.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.020
I understand.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.180
As long as you do, shall we get started?

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.270
I'm not as soft as you might think.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.450
We're not making any compromises.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.710
Tie all the old magazines together.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.360
Break down the cardboard and pile it up.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.570
Tsuneno Milk

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.570
Water

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.150
Separate the lids from the plastic bottles.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.050
Cleaning starts from the top.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.430
Put all of your dirty laundry
in the basket for now.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.250
Next, the top of the air conditioner.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.140
Oh!

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.630
Fujimiya-san.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.510
The reason you clean is to
keep things like this from happening.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.520
Please accept my deepest apologies.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.490
Should we keep going?

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:49.860
I guess so.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:55.950
That surprised me!

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:00.950
All cleaned up.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.170
It took a whole day to get this much done.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.800
Yeah, the place was trashed.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.900
You're the one who trashed it, you know.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.280
'Tis as you say.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.420
Oh boy...

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:17.090
I don't feel like going shopping now.
Want to order a pizza for dinner?

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.340
Huh?

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.400
So this is a delivery pizza.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.730
You've never ordered delivery before?

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.700
Are your parents really strict about food?

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.400
At home, we had a housekeeper cook for us.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.280
A housekeeper?

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.780
You must be pretty rich then.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:42.280
I suppose you could say
we're somewhat well-off.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.690
Well, I don't know if this is up to
your standards, but help yourself.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:51.810
Thank you for the food.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.140
What is it?

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.090
Nothing.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.170
You're just making it look delicious.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.230
Please don't stare at me so much.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.480
How do I put this...
you really have zero charm.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.230
That is fine with me.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.480
Yeah, I guess that's okay.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.860
I think I'm more used to
you here than at school.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.450
I like this you more though,
because she's easier to get along with.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.610
The one without charm, you mean?

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.340
You don't let things go, do you?

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.100
What I mean is,
even if you seem a little unfriendly,

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.000
you're a lot more approachable
when you're honest about your feelings.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:40.510
Is my behavior at school really that awful?

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.890
Well, no.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:45.300
But don't you get worn out
always acting like that?

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.300
Not really.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.990
I've been like this since I was little.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.270
That's pretty hard-core.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.020
Well, at least you have a place
where you can catch your breath a little.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:01.140
I can't catch my breath with your
staring always putting me on edge.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.580
So sorry about that.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.410
Fujimiya

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.410
Thank you for dinner.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.140
Can I ask you one thing?

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:09.910
What is it?

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.910
What do you get out of sharing
your dinner with me every day?

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.510
My own satisfaction.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.420
It's really not a big deal.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.800
Simply put, I think I just like
preparing meals for people.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:30.560
And you don't take that the wrong way,
you just tell me it's good, so it's easy.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:36.380
I'm not comfortable with the way you eat
anyway, so I guess it's my own satisfaction.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.810
Is that what this is?

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.600
That's what it is.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.440
So just think of it as an unexpected
splash of good luck for you.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.860
Well, well.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.860
All right then, please excuse me.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.330
I guess that's really all this is.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:03.820
This is how the angel and I began
our unusual next-door relationship.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.980
Next Time
