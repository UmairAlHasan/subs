00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,972
<i>Point One. Nothing
out of the ordinary so far.</i>

3
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:17,892
<i>Alpha Two, this is CP.
Continue monitoring the situation.</i>

00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:33,825
<i>Emergency kaiju alert.</i>

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,829
YOKOHAMA GATE
EMERGENCY UNDERGROUND SHELTER

6
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:42,375
<i>Emergency kaiju alert for Minami,
Naka, and Isogo Wards.</i>

7
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,838
<i>All those in the designated zones,
please proceed to a shelter immediately.</i>

8
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,051
<i>As for the movements of the epicenter...</i>

9
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,226
<i>The target is moving
from Yatobashi to Yamashitacho.</i>

10
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,898
{\an8}<i>Estimated full length is 60 meters.
Fortitude is a little less than 3,5.</i>

11
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,579
-<i>No thermal detection for 3 kilometers.
-Roger that.</i>

12
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,373
<i>All crafts, begin shooting. I repeat.</i>

13
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,084
-<i>Begin shooting.
-Roger that.</i>

14
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,878
<i>Leading target to TO.</i>

15
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,671
<i>Shoot.</i>

16
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,596
Will the intimidation work?

17
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,848
Which division is coming?

18
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,226
It's Yokohama, so, the Third Division.

19
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,807
Geez, what a mess.

20
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,021
We'll be working overtime for a while.

21
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,316
All right, let's get to work!

22
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,151
Yes, sir.

23
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,698
<i>Members of the Third Division,
who successfully subdued the kaiju,</i>

24
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,700
<i>are welcomed by the applause of locals.</i>

25
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,622
<i>The Third Division
achieved zero casualties.</i>

26
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,540
-<i>Thanks to them...</i>
-Captain Ashiro's here!

27
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,125
How cool!

28
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,630
<i>Let us thank them
with applause and cheers.</i>

29
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,507
Hey, don't forget to film the victims!

30
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,967
Oh, sorry.

31
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,471
-Report back to me later!
-Yes, sir!

32
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,847
Captain Ashiro!

33
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:01,658
<i>Our work begins
after everything has ended.</i>

34
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,536
<i>No one gives us attention.</i>

35
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,998
<i>No one thanks us either.</i>

36
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,418
<i>But it's our way of battling kaiju,</i>

37
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,884
<i>behind the scenes,
away from the spotlight.</i>

38
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,885
KAFKA HIBINO

39
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,472
<i>Kafka! Izumo Tech wants some samples.</i>

40
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,101
<i>Thanks.</i>

41
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,895
It's no good! I can't cut past the grease.

42
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,107
-Bring me the heat chainsaw!
-Yes, sir!

43
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,651
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't lift that yet!

44
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,661
It's this way! Bring the stretcher.

45
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,247
Don't worry, it's just the surface.

46
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,584
I've done this many times.
Don't forget to apply for workers' comp.

47
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,752
Yes, sir!

48
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:59,257
The Third Division's site is always messy.

49
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,092
It's hard to recognize the organs.

50
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,053
Jesus, look at this.

51
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,265
Will we really finish this week?

52
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,729
Kafka, we're moving you.

53
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,356
-We don't have enough people over there.
-Where is it?

54
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,984
The intestines.

55
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,324
-I don't want to!
-I already got permission. Let's go!

56
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,200
Sorry about that!

57
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,204
I always hear about it,
but is working the intestines that rough?

58
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,958
{\an8}Think about it.
What's inside the intestines?

59
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:34,959
{\an8}HOW THE BODY WORKS

60
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,545
The days we work intestines...

61
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,799
you can't eat for days.

62
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,644
I'm so tired!

63
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,231
<i>Those baby pandas were so cute!</i>

64
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,858
<i>How will they grow up?</i>

65
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,819
I can still smell it.

66
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,072
<i>Let's move on to the next topic.</i>

67
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:09,994
<i>Defense Force Third Division,
which successfully subdued the kaiju</i>

68
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,246
<i>that suddenly appeared in the streets
of Yokohama.</i>

69
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:18,503
<i>The leader of that division
is Officer Mina Ashiro-san.</i>

70
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,713
<i>At the young age of 27,</i>

71
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,926
<i>she not only became the captain
but has already defeated</i>

72
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,803
{\an8}<i>hundreds of kaiju.</i>

73
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,929
‪SPECIAL FEATURE:
‪ZOOMING IN ON THE THIRD DIVISION

74
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,556
Let's defeat all the kaiju together!

75
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,271
CAPTAIN MINA ASHIRO

76
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,774
<i>Her calm and dignified disposition</i>

77
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,444
<i>makes her one of the most popular captains
of the entire Defense Force.</i>

78
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,489
<i>She's rumored to be the next
potential Division Commander.</i>

79
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,950
<i>She's definitely an up-and-coming star.</i>

80
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,712
Why am I over here?

81
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,007
Don't think about it!

82
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:09,220
Cleaning is important work
that also helps people!

83
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,348
I have a nice room

84
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,308
and can eat whatever I want.

85
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,854
That's enough, isn't it?

86
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,488
<i>My head hurts.</i>

87
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,907
<i>It's definitely that TV show's fault!</i>

{\an8}‪MONSTER SWEEPER INC.

89
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,791
Good morning.

90
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,919
Kafka's here! Come this way!

91
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,006
-I'm going to start getting ready!
-All right.

92
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,924
-Morning, Kafka.
-Hey.

93
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,345
This is Ichikawa-kun. He'll work
with us part-time, starting today.

94
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,931
{\an8}His dream is to join the Defense Force!

95
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,311
That was his dream too, you know?

96
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,856
He's already given up,
and he's a veteran here!

97
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,858
<i>This is the worst!</i>

98
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,276
Toku-san,

99
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,070
-how's he supposed to react to that?
-Why...

100
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,116
Why did you give up?

101
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,166
I tried my best, you know?

102
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,627
But there are so many talented people.

103
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,631
I hit a wall to my potential.

104
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,759
-You'll understand when you're older...
-I won't.

105
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:35,014
I'll never give up.
I'll never understand until the day I die.

106
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,391
Not that I want to.

107
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,102
-Hey, where are you...
-I'm getting changed.

108
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,064
Geez.

109
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,442
I thought you two would get along well.

110
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,027
<i>That's unfair!</i>

111
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,198
<i>No matter how I respond to that,
I'd be a pathetic loser!</i>

112
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:56,661
<i>Is it such a bad thing to give up?</i>

113
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,251
All right, let's start.

114
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,337
Team Miike, continue cleaning the bones.

115
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,880
Keep everything intact

116
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,465
-and send it over to Izumo Tech.
-Yes, sir!

117
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,969
Team Yoshimura will dismantle the legs.
Everything will be discarded.

118
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,303
Yes, sir.

119
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,180
The newbies get the intestines.
Come with me.

120
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,098
Yes, sir.

121
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,183
<i>All right! Serves you right!</i>

122
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,061
-Kafka, you're intestines, too.
-Me too?

123
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,315
-This is my second day in a row!
-You're good at it though.

124
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,319
Dammit, bring it on!

125
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,032
He always stands up
to the challenge in the end.

126
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,787
If he had passed, he would've been
a great Defense Force member.

127
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,001
Seriously?

128
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,131
<i>He's suffering big time!</i>

129
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,802
<i>Same goes for me.</i>

130
00:09:56,137 --> 00:10:00,683
Hey, is that all you brought to eat?

131
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,060
I don't think I can eat this.

132
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,146
I'm sure.

133
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,149
-Here.
-What is it...

134
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,151
Ow!

135
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,155
{\an8}That's for you.
Eat whatever you're able to.

136
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,948
You have to get through the day.

137
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,993
-I'll be fine...
-I'll give you these also.

138
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,786
These make it much more tolerable.

139
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,040
I don't know what you're saying,

140
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,042
but I seriously don't need those...

141
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,503
Don't be shy. Just put them on.

142
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,631
Senpai, that's workplace harassment!

143
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,008
This is a rite of passage for all newbies.

144
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,820
Carry your own stuff, okay?

145
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,406
-Good work today!
-Good work!

146
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,911
-See you!
-Good work today.

147
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,000
We got through the smelliest areas.

148
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,718
Senpai.

149
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,513
Hey, Ichikawa.

150
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:24,517
Are you here to get back at me for lunch?

151
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,685
Thanks to you...

152
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,188
Thanks to you, I survived my first day.

153
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,192
Thank you, sir.

154
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,949
That's all.

155
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,159
Goodbye.

156
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:50,126
Also, they're raising the age limit
to under 33.

157
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,378
To join the Defense Force.

158
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,465
Because of the low birthrates.

159
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,177
It's your life,
so, it's none of my business,

160
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,764
but when you said you gave up,

161
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,059
you looked really sad, that's all.

162
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,188
It seriously doesn't matter to me.

163
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:15,317
If I got it all wrong, you're free
to give up all you want.

164
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,402
Bye!

165
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,946
Ichikawa.

166
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,033
Thanks.

167
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,287
You're nicer than you look.

168
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,373
I told you that's not what this is about!

169
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,425
Senpai?

170
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,267
<i>Yoju?</i>

171
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,524
Run, Ichikawa! Get as far away as you can!

172
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,861
Once you're in a safe area, make a report.

173
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,780
-But senpai, you'd be alone...
-Having two won't make a difference!

174
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,200
You're joining the Force, right?

175
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,453
Don't die here!

176
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,175
Here! I'm over here!

177
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,454
<i>Over there!</i>

178
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,421
<i>I did it.</i>

179
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,257
<i>Now, I can...</i>

180
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,304
Goddammit!

181
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:28,367
It's all gone.
Your home, my home, our school.

182
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,162
I won't forgive kaiju!

183
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,790
I was almost done
with all the GlaMon stages!

184
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,167
That's why you're sad?

185
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,054
I'm sad that Meeko died.

186
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,017
Meeko's your calico cat, right?

187
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,369
-I'm going to join the Defense Force.
-I'm going to join the Defense Force.

188
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,916
Hey, you're just a kid!

189
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,168
You're still in elementary school too,
Kafka-kun!

190
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,884
In that case,

191
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,387
let's bet on who becomes
the coolest Defense Force officer!

192
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,641
Let's defeat all the kaiju together!

193
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,646
<i>Shit. It wasn't supposed to be like this!</i>

194
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,611
<i>Shit!</i>

195
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,575
<i>Kaiju don't scare me!</i>

196
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,248
<i>Aim for the leg. The leg...</i>

197
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,881
<i>How did I get here?</i>

198
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,301
Let's bet on who becomes
the coolest officer!

199
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,624
Ichikawa?

200
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:46,046
-You idiot! Why...
-I made the report!

201
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,340
That's not what I'm talking about!

202
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,595
If I leave you here and run,

203
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,183
I'd never become a Defense Force officer!

204
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,561
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU...

205
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,231
<i>Shit.</i>

206
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,483
TOTSUKA CONSTRUCTION

207
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,527
<i>Shit.</i>

208
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,780
<i>Shit!</i>

209
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,492
<i>Why am I so weak?</i>

210
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,619
<i>I haven't grown at all.</i>

211
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,498
<i>I can't even protect my own video game,
a friend's cat,</i>

212
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,460
<i>even my own kohai!</i>

213
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,797
Shit!

214
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,982
Target defeated.
I see an injured civilian.

215
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,069
Rescue operation will continue.

216
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,114
{\an8}Igarashi, Takaragi,
look after the injured.

217
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,032
{\an8}JAPAN DEFENSE FORCE THIRD DIVISION

218
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,326
Everyone else, follow me.

219
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,286
We'll look for any remaining yoju.

220
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,045
-Are you all right?
-Don't move. Stay still.

221
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,076
<i>Mina is so cool.</i>

222
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,871
<i>She crushed that frightening monster
with one blow.</i>

223
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,169
<i>She's somewhere far away from me now.</i>

224
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,005
Senpai.

225
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,595
After the kaiju appeared

226
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,181
and you told me to run,

227
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,977
if you didn't save me then,

228
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,272
I would've died today.

229
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,817
You were really cool.

230
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,614
Let's bet on who becomes
the coolest Defense Force officer!

231
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,661
I really think you should be
a Defense Force officer.

232
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,709
Well, it's your life, so it doesn't
matter to me.

233
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,838
You're right.

234
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:38,343
<i>When will I stop looking away
from what's important!?</i>

235
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,848
Thanks, Ichikawa.

236
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,352
You're a really good guy.

237
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,814
I don't think it's a bad thing to give up,

238
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,027
but it's bad to lie to yourself!

239
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,947
I'm going to try joining
the Defense Force again...

240
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,291
What?

241
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,877
I found you.

242
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,671
Kai... Kai...

243
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,966
Senpai?

244
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,889
Does your injury hurt?

245
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,643
Senpai!

246
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,369
What?

247
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,955
-What?
-Ichikawa, it's me!

248
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,916
Don't get so scared!

249
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,214
OH...

250
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,590
He's reporting you.

251
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,467
Let's run, senpai!

252
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,679
What?

253
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,770
{\an8}‪ORIGINAL WORK BY: NAOYA MATSUMOTO

254
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,195
When you encounter a kaiju,

255
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,447
you should attack its legs,

256
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,117
tie it up, and make sure it can't move.

257
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,120
It's a little scary.

258
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,747
What is?

259
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,627
Imagining what it's like to fight a kaiju
that's so much bigger than you.

260
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,549
It'll be okay.

261
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,053
Anytime that happens,

262
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,432
I'll be right next to you!

263
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,021
Liar.

264
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,694
Yes.

265
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,615
A kaiju appeared
at South Yokohama Hospital?

266
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,742
Yes.

267
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,955
No, there's no problem.

268
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,749
I'll dispatch my officers right away.

269
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,751
Yes, we'll kill it.
